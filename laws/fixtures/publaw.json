align=\"justify\" class=\"indentParagraph\">(1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their children, including the educational setting that will best serve the interests and educational needs of their child.</p><a NAME=\"HAEAE14F2FB42453E9724248EC99C4310\"></a><p align=\"justify\" class=\"indentParagraph\">(2) For many parents in the District of Columbia, public school choice provided under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as well as under other public school choice programs, is inadequate. More educational options are needed to ensure all families in the District of Columbia have access to a quality education. In particular, funds are needed to provide low-income parents with enhanced public opportunities and private educational environments, regardless of whether such environments are secular or nonsecular.</p><a NAME=\"HBE5BF6BEB1ED4060AF076F320BC233D6\"></a><p align=\"justify\" class=\"indentParagraph\">(3) While the per student cost for students in the public schools of the District of Columbia is one of the highest in the United States, test scores for such students continue to be among the lowest in the Nation. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), an annual report released by the National Center for Education Statistics, reported in its 2009 study that students in the District of Columbia were being outperformed by every State in the Nation. On the 2009 NAEP, 56 percent of fourth grade students scored \u201cbelow basic\u201d in reading, and 44 percent scored \u201cbelow basic\u201d in mathematics. Among eighth grade students, 49 percent scored \u201cbelow basic\u201d in reading and 60 percent scored \u201cbelow basic\u201d in mathematics. On the 2009 NAEP reading assessment, only 17 percent of the District of Columbia fourth grade students could read proficiently, while only 13 percent of the eighth grade students scored at the proficient or advanced level.</p><a NAME=\"H925547C79E454BEDACFC53DBED5F6236\"></a><p align=\"justify\" class=\"indentParagraph\">(4) In 2003, Congress passed the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 (<a href=\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ199.108.pdf\">Public Law 108\u2013199</a>; 118 Stat. 126), to provide opportunity scholarships to parents of students in the District of Columbia to enable them to pursue a high-quality education at a public or private elementary or secondary school of their choice. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP) under such Act was part of a comprehensive 3-part funding arrangement that also included additional funds for the District of Columbia public schools, and additional funds for public charter schools of the District of Columbia. The intent of the approach was to ensure that progress would continue to be made to improve public schools and public charter schools, and that funding for the opportunity scholarship program would not lead to a reduction in funding for the District of Columbia public and charter schools. Resources would be available for a variety of educational options that would give families in the District of Columbia a range of choices with regard to the education of their children.</p><a NAME=\"H3D37F554549C4C5FAA4F50335F38AA40\"></a><p align=\"justify\" class=\"indentParagraph\">(5) The DC OSP was established in accordance with the Supreme Court decision, Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639 (2002), which found that a program enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to low-income children in a demonstrably failing public school system is constitutional if it is neutral with respect to religion and provides assistance to a broad class of citizens who direct government aid to religious and secular schools solely as a result of their genuine and independent private choices.</p><a NAME=\"H3C654B8707244129801C47F6A782E435\"></a><p align=\"justify\" class=\"indentParagraph\">(6) Since the inception of the DC OSP, it has consistently been oversubscribed. Parents express strong support for the opportunity scholarship program. Rigorous studies of the program by the Institute of Education Sciences have shown significant improvements in parental satisfaction and in reading scores that are more dramatic when only those students consistently using the scholarships are considered. The program also was found to result in significantly higher graduation rates for DC OSP students.</p><a NAME=\"H3B049A748F4448D9B10D30BD24C2F756\"></a><p align=\"justify\" class=\"indentParagraph\">(7) The DC OSP is a program that offers families in need, in the District of Columbia, important alternatives while public schools are improved.
