OMB estimates that the first part will reduce spending by $1.2 trillion (this may seem confusing, because the commonly-used figure for this part was $900 billion originally).\u00a0</p>\n<p>In combination with the debt-limit deal, then, the new proposals would (a) pay for the stimulus package the President proposed and (b) still reduce 10-year deficits by $4.4 trillion.\u00a0 Changes of this size constitute &#8220;going big&#8221; in current budget parlance and should be applauded.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Joint Select Committee needs to come up with &#8220;just&#8221; $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction to avoid the automatic second-round cuts.\u00a0 The President is asking Congress to go well beyond that and make a much more significant dent in the fiscal problem now.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(2)\u00a0 Compared to what?</span></p>\n<p>The baseline that OMB uses is a measure of &#8220;current policy&#8221;:\u00a0 it assumes the extension of all of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the indexation of the AMT for inflation, the non-reduction of Medicare provider payments, and the continuation of military operations at full throttle in Iraq and Afghanistan (it does not appear to assume that the run-of-the-mill temporary tax policies, the so-called &#8220;extenders,&#8221; are extended).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I have argued elsewhere that, in many ways, it makes more sense to use current law as the baseline.\u00a0(<a href=\"/posts/external/368/\">/posts/external/368/</a>)\u00a0 Ultimately, the most important thing is where the proposal ends up in terms of deficits, debt, taxes, and spending.\u00a0 The President\u2019s proposal would put the country on a more sustainable fiscal path and buy significant time to deal with long-term problems.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(3)\u00a0 Timing </span></p>\n<p>The combination of the President\u2019s stimulus proposal and the medium-term deficit reduction measures would raise the deficit by $300 billion in 2012, and then would reduce the deficit (all, relative to baseline) by $23 billion in 2013, by almost $300 billion in 2014, and by increasing amounts thereafter.\u00a0 If the economy has fully recovered by 2013, it will be able to bear the burden of changes in the direction and magnitude of the deficit.\u00a0 But if the economy is still weak, the increase in fiscal drag in 2013 and 2014 may cause significant problems.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(4)\u00a0 The Role of Taxes </span></p>\n<p>The President is right to call for tax increases as part of medium-term deficit reduction. As <a href=\"/posts/external/369/\">I described last month</a>, any credible proposal to solve our fiscal problem will include an increase in government revenue.</p>\n<p>\u2013All major durable deficit reduction packages enacted in the last thirty years, including the 1983 Social Security reforms and the 1990 and 1993 budget agreements, included both tax increases and spending cuts.</p>\n<p>\u2013The only way to provide shared sacrifice is by including tax increases in the package. Spending cuts do not require any significant sacrifice from very high-income households.</p>\n<p>\u2013The notion that government can be reduced in size by holding taxes low has not fared well over the last 30 years.\u00a0 The &#8220;starve the beast&#8221; approach was tried by Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush, who cut taxes, but ended up raising spending.\u00a0 In contrast, when President Clinton raised taxes, government also reduced spending, resulting in better fiscal discipline on both sides of the budget.</p>\n<p>\u2013Tax increases will be needed, too, because historical revenue levels will not be sufficient to pay for the costs of an aging population with rapidly rising medical costs.\u00a0 Even with significant reforms of Medicare and Medicaid, health costs will place a significant burden on the federal budget.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013Because the debt-limit deal focuses only on spending cuts, adding tax increases as one part of the new package will help, in all of the ways described above.\u00a0 The overall package looks to have about a 2:1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases.</p>\n<p>\u2013A combination of tax increases and spending cuts is in accord with the wishes of the American public, who vastly prefer a combination of the two types of budget solutions to a solution that involves spending cuts alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(5)\u00a0 Taxes on high-income households </span></p>\n<p>It is appropriate to include tax increases on high-income households as part of the fiscal package.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013High-income households have seen enormous income growth over the past 30 years, which has not been reflected fully in the tax revenue statistics.\u00a0 The share of total income going to the top 1 percent has more than doubled, rising from 9.3 percent of pre-tax income in 1979 to 19.4 percent in 2007.\u00a0 In a progressive tax system, where average tax rates rise with income, one would expect that such a massive increase in income would be coupled\u2014in the absence of any change in tax law\u2013with significantly higher average tax rates (since more income is taxed at the highest rate as income skyrockets).\u00a0 Instead, the average federal tax rate on the top 1 percent of households fell over the time period from 37 percent in 1979 to 29.5 percent in 2007. \u00a0(As a result, the share of federal taxes paid by the top 1 percent went up by less than double (even though the income share more than doubled) to 28.1 percent in 2007, up from 15.4 percent in 1979.)</p>\n<p>\u2013In contrast, the middle and lower ends of the income distribution have shown very small gains over the past 30 years.\u00a0 According to the Census, median family income after adjusting for inflation only increased 7.3 percent since 1979.\u00a0 More recently, median real family income has declined over the past decade, with median income in 2010 7.1 percent below its 1999 peak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013The President&#8217;s proposal would return tax rates for high-income households to their late-1990s levels, a period of strong economic growth. Even though the tax rates of the 1990s did not cause the strong economic growth, it is clear that they did not get in the way of the strongest growth period the nation has had in several decades.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013Proposed taxes on high-income households seem to always generate two responses \u2013 it will hurt small business and it constitutes class warfare \u2013 which are discussed below.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(6)\u00a0 Small business </span></p>\n<p>There will be concerns voiced that raising taxes on high-income households will hurt small businesses.\u00a0 However, the case can be vastly overstated.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013First, the proposed tax rates will not affect the vast majority of small businesses. \u00a0According to the IRS&#8217; 2009 Statistics of Income, only 9.9 percent of tax returns reporting business income were filed by taxpayers with an adjusted gross income greater than $250,000. \u00a0Second, businesses in the upper income brackets are naturally larger than those in the lower brackets, and account for almost half of the aggregate income of so-called &#8220;small business,&#8221; but it is unclear that many of these businesses are indeed small.\u00a0 (For example, when Goldman Sachs was a partnership, the income of its managers would show up as &#8220;small business&#8221; income.)\u00a0 Moreover, most of the income in those income groups is not business income.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013Those statistics aside, the effective tax rate on small business income is likely to be zero or negative, regardless of small changes in the marginal tax rates.\u00a0 This is for three reasons.\u00a0 First, small businesses can expense (immediately deduct in full) the cost of investment. This alone brings the effective tax rate on new investment to zero, regardless of the statutory rate.\u00a0 Second, if they can finance the investment with debt, the interest payments would be tax deductible, making the effective tax rate negative.\u00a0 Third, they can deduct wage payments in full, so the marginal tax rate should have minimal impact on hiring.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(7)\u00a0 Class Warfare </span></p>\n<p>Proposals to raise taxes on high-income households inevitably generate claims of &#8220;class warfare.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u2013But it seems reasonable to ask for some fiscal sacrifice from a group that (a) is very well off, (b) has seen meteoric income gains relative to the rest of the population over the past 30 years, and (c) has nevertheless seen their average tax burden fall, not rise, during that period. It does not seem fair to let the wealthiest escape from sharing the burden of closing the fiscal gap; nor is there a way to impose that burden without tax increases.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013Ironically, proposals like Rep. Ryan&#8217;s recent plan to address long-term fiscal issues would impose more than the full burden of closing the fiscal gap on low- and middle-income households and, at the same time, give high-income households a tax cut.\u00a0 That seems much less justified on fairness grounds than asking high-income households to share in the burden of closing the fiscal gap.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">(8)\u00a0 The Buffett rule </span></p>\n<p>As a guideline for future tax reform (but not as a specific proposal now), the President described\u00a0 &#8220;the Buffett rule,&#8221; (named with reference to Warren Buffett, who has commented that he faces a lower average tax rate than many of his employees) as implying that no one with income over $1 million should pay a smaller share of his income in taxes than middle class families pay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013The notion that people with income above $1 million should pay higher average tax rates than those in the middle class should not be a controversial proposition in principle. \u00a0It is simply an extremely mild form of progressive taxation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013However, the guidelines say &#8220;no household&#8221; with income above $1 million, which might create issues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2013The mild form of progressivity may not hold in the current system because different income types have different tax rates. These income types are concentrated in certain income groups more than others. For example, wages and salaries, which are a big share of low- and middle-income households\u2019 income but not of high-income households\u2019 income, are taxed at a flat payroll tax rate (up to a maximum) and graduated income tax rates. Capital gains and dividends are taxed at very low rates (15 percent maximum) under the individual income tax; these constitute less than 1 percent of the income of the bottom 80 percent of the income distribution, but more than 30 percent of the top 1 percent of households (in 2007, the figure will vary from year to year). \u00a0According to Tax Policy Center estimates, the top one-tenth of one percent of households receive almost half of the benefits from preferential rates on capital gains and dividends. \u00a0Low- and middle-income households cannot benefit from these tax breaks like millionaires, nor can they exploit other tax loopholes and deductions like high-income households.</p>\n<p>\u2013The Buffett Rule could be implemented in different ways: via a surtax on those whose income exceeds $1 million; via a reformed Alternative Minimum Tax (which would ensure that high-income, not middle-income, households are primarily affected); or via elimination or reduction of preferential rates for dividends and capital gains. \u00a0The goal of a progressive tax system is laudable and should be pursued, especially as the greatest income gains have benefitted the top while median incomes have stagnated.</p>\n<p><em>William G.

Kohl, a tax lawyer colorful enough to publicly compare himself to Bruce Springsteen and to joke in the pages of The Wall Street Journal that his dog, Rubin, shared the name of the Treasury secretary under whom he served (Robert E. Rubin). <br /><br />\"After working in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration, Mr. Kohl entered the private sector and became head of E.A.\u2019s tax department in 2004, leading the company as it aggressively lobbied for a federal tax break on domestic production and set up a matrix of offshore subsidiaries, many in low-tax countries.\" <br /><br />Kohl appears not to have been interviewed on the record for the article, but he is also discussed at length later on.  It mentions that, before joining Electronic Arts in 2004, he \"co-authored a widely-cited proposal urging the federal government to crack down on corporate tax avoidance, warning that 'the tax shelter problem is simply too detrimental to the tax system not to act.' As head of tax at Electronic Arts, he became a noted expert in using foreign subsidiaries to legally, and sharply, cut a corporation\u2019s United States tax bill. As a co-chairman of the Silicon Valley Tax Directors Group, he also moderated a seminar in 2010 that showed technology companies how to use offshore subsidiaries to reassign the licensing of their intellectual property and, in some cases, reduce their effective federal tax rate substantially from 35 percent.\"<br /><br />So it's a classic praise / pan, in some ways making him look great (smart, important, influential, creative, effective) but also no doubt prompting invidious musings from many readers about what might underlie the change in persona that appears to have taken hold around 2004 or so.<br /><br />I should put my own cards on the table here and note that Glen and I are old law school classmates, and that I consider him a friend (hopefully, notwithstanding my topic choice here).  Few if any in my law school class were so charismatic, energetic, or widely known and liked.  For that matter, he was (and no doubt remains) far less self-important than Bruce Springsteen.  Closer in intellectual outlook to Stephen Malkmus minus the diffidence, and coming from me that's high praise.<br /><br />But the story of his evolution pre-2004 versus post-2003 certainly reflects the sort of incentives people face in the tax and business world - not just financially, although that's obviously very important, but in other ways as well.  There are only so many ways to hit the really big leagues, develop and showcase your professional talents, and express your intellectual creativity, especially if you don't choose (or it isn't quite your thing) to toil in the obscure groves of academe, laboring to develop what you consider insights that maybe 300 people will download and 40 or so truly appreciate.  And there may be unfortunate social byproducts to how talent thus ends up being directed.<br /><br />Call it a cautionary tale, with an individually but not socially happy ending.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-8358055534386688269?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/382/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1330, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Is Social Security a Ponzi scheme?", "text": "Since Rick Perry keeps calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme, let's examine the accuracy of this characterization.<br /><br />A true Ponzi scheme has two main elements.  First, new investors' contributions are used to pay old investors' benefits.  Second, an exploding or unsustainable growth rate is needed to keep the promised or expected benefits coming.  (A chain letter where you ask six people to send you a dollar, and they then each ask six people to send them a dollar, is a classic example.)<br /><br />Social Security has the first of these two elements, reflecting program cash flows and the initial decision, made when the program was started during the Great Depression while millions of seniors faced ineradicable poverty, to start paying benefits to retirees who had not significantly contributed to the program.<br /><br />This alone, however, is not problematic in the way that the term \"Ponzi scheme\" inevitably suggests.  If you think it is problematic and thus justifies the label, here's another non-exploding and seemingly Ponzi-like scheme for you.  My family, like many others, has for countless generations been running this incredibly Ponzi-like scheme called \"parenting.\"  As a baby you get these free benefits, paid by your parents via their labor in raising you.  Then when you grow up you pay in to the plan (if you have children) by raising your kids.<br /><br />Surely this is even worse than Social Security.  After all, at least in Social Security you pay your taxes before you get your benefits.  Here, you get your benefits first!  But there's still the key feature that you don't self-finance, i.e., raise yourself from infancy.  Instead, each cohort relies on an adjoining one to pay it.  Yet somehow this audacious scheme has proved sustainable over time.<br /><br />So there really is no Ponzi scheme unless an exploding or unsustainable growth rate is needed to keep the promised or expected benefits coming.  How does Social Security rank in this regard?<br /><br />As it happens, the program does not have a well-defined relationship between taxes paid in and benefits that are promised.  This depends on how the payroll tax rate and base on the one hand, and the benefit formula on the other hand (each subject to statutory modification at any time), happen to play out given birth rates, life expectancies, wage growth, employment levels, etcetera.<br /><br />But in Paul Samuelson's famous conceptualization of Social Security in a classic 1958 article, we can think of the program as one in which everyone would get back exactly the amount they paid in if, among other simplifying abstractions, wages and population were constant over time and everyone's life consisted of a fixed \"work period\" followed by a \"retirement period.\"  Throw in population growth and rising real wage levels, and Samuelson foresaw a positive rate of return to Social Security retirees (possibly exceeding the real interest rate, in a Peter Diamond extension of the model) that depended on those two factors.  That is, if we imagine payroll taxes being handed over to retirees in a strict pay-as-you-go system, the amount available to be paid over rises if the workforce grows along with wages that are subject to the payroll tax.<br /><br />There's nothing Ponzi-like about that; it's entirely sustainable.  But in actual Social Security, two things went \"wrong.\" One was the baby bust after the baby boom, while the second, more important change was rising post-retirement life expectancies.  Having retirees live longer was equivalent to having more of them, and had adverse effects on worker to retiree ratios even if each demographic cohort was larger than the one that came before.<br /><br />Does this mean that Social Security became a Ponzi scheme after all?  Strictly speaking, absolutely not.  If we think of Social Security retirement benefits as being adjusted to reflect changing payroll tax revenue levels (even though this is only true, if at all, over the long run), then we'd say that retirees hold an implicit financial instrument, the payoff on which depends on wage and demographic trends.  So all that rising life expectancies does in this scenario is cause the payoff to be lower rather than higher than it would otherwise have been.  But that's in the nature of the implicit financial instrument - a built-in feature that does not cause Ponzi-like collapse, but merely affects the actual payouts from a program that can keep on running anyway.<br /><br />This brings us to the point that comes closest to justifying Perry's angry braying about Social Security.  The program's retirement benefits do not automatically adjust for these demographic changes.  Instead, barring Congressional legislation, they proceed on statutory autopilot (albeit depending in practice on demographic and macroeconomic outcomes).  So if adverse demographic changes do not lead to immediate tax or benefit changes, you get a program shortfall that emerges over time, and currently promised benefits become eventually unsustainable without new financing.<br /><br />That, however, is merely lag in adjusting the actual rules on the books to keep on track with the Samuelson structure that is implied by having a largely pay-as-you-go scheme.  And it does not mean that the program will collapse - merely that benefits will need at some point to be adversely adjusted (say, to the tune of 20 or 30 percent) in the absence of increased financing.<br /><br />Perry is right (words that I must confess I hate typing) insofar as his point is that the current scheme requires adjustment, and that people won't get the full benefits promised by present law unless there is extra financing.  But he is very substantially wrong in comparing this to a Ponzi scheme in which, as we well know, the investors (except for the lucky ones who got out fast) end up with nothing.<br /><br />It would be more accurate to compare Social Security to an investment that has historically produced one rate of return, but which in fact appears likely to offer you a lower rate of return.  E.g., suppose stock prices have historically appreciated, over a long period of time, at about 2% annually in real terms. You now hold stocks and are hoping to earn that rate of return.  But suppose we can see the future well enough to anticipate that, in fact, you will end up learning less than that (and perhaps even a zero or modestly negative rate of return).  That's too bad, but it doesn't make stock market investment a Ponzi scheme.<br /><br />The negative adjustment to expected returns also obviously does not make mandatory retirement saving (a key feature of Social Security) a bad idea, given that lifetime consumption smoothing is necessary unless you're happy to have two houses and two dinners a day now, followed by none of either when you're old.<br /><br />In sum, \"Ponzi scheme\" is really out of place as a description of Social Security, even though the program has financing problems.  It's true that there have been some negative shocks to expected returns from the program, and that since it doesn't automatically self-adjust there will be a rising expected long-term program deficit until Congress gets around to adjusting things.  But this is way out of Ponzi territory.<br /><br />What about Medicare?  That program is best described as Samuelson-plus.  Program participants \"bet\" not only on economic and demographic trends, but also on the trend in healthcare expenditure relative to GDP.  (When that rises, the program becomes costlier under constant benefit design.)  What makes Medicare far more fiscally unsustainable than Social Security is the fact that healthcare expenditure levels have been significantly rising relative to GDP - and unsustainably so whether there is a government financing role or not.<br /><br />Medicare is closer to Ponzi territory if we posit an implicit commitment, not just to the current statutory design, but to covering so large a percentage of seniors' healthcare outlays under a system where they so frequently can get the best procedures that are technologically available at a given moment.  The built-in unsustainability comes from purporting to guarantee something that is itself growing at an exploding rate.  But that is a piece of the broader healthcare problem that we face, more than an aspect of Medicare as such.  So calling Medicare a Ponzi scheme (which even Perry does not seem inclined to do) is less illuminating than saying that healthcare generally is on an unsustainable growth path in our society, that we will need to address in one way or another.<br /><br />UPDATE: Looking at Perry's statement more closely (although in this post I was more interested in the pervasive \"Ponzi scheme\" meme than in his murky mental processes), I see that his operating definition appears to be that, if the system is going to go kaput and pay you zero, then from your standpoint it is a Ponzi scheme.  That is certainly a reasonable way to define Ponzi schemes.  But of course it is wildly inaccurate as applied to Social Security, which is projected to be able (based on expected future Trust Funds) to pay about 75 percent of future retirees' benefits.  So he is using what we will charitably call his own facts, rather than the actual ones, in calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.<br /><br />Interesting point about Perry: While he obviously feels entitled to his own facts, rather than the actual ones, on global warming, evolution, Keynesian stimulus, Social Security, etcetera, he apparently caused his last two gubernatorial campaigns to run very serious empirical tests regarding how alternative types of campaign expenditures and activities actually contribute to electoral success.  See the NY times blog article <a href=\"/posts/external/384/\">here</a>.  In other words, this would appear to be a guy who (contrary to so much evidence from his cheap talk) actually knows and cares about expertise and empirical proof, in cases where there is something in it for him.  But if there is no direct personal benefit to him, then he evidently doesn't care.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-3049757985105111310?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/385/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1331, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "What would Nixon do?", "text": "The opening of today's New York Times <a href=\"/posts/external/386/\">article</a> on President Obama's forthcoming jobs package really turned my stomach:<br /><br />\"The centerpiece of the job creation package that President Obama plans to announce on Thursday \u2014 payroll tax relief for workers and perhaps their employers \u2014 is neither his first policy choice nor that of many economists. But it is the one that they figure has the best chance of getting Republicans\u2019 support.\"<br /><br />So typical of this Administration.  They decide up front to advocate what they agree is very far from being the best available, policy - in order to give themselves \"the best chance of getting Republicans\u2019 support.\"<br /><br />All this notwithstanding that the Administration's actual chance of getting that support is zero.  Not 0.00001%.  Zero.  At least, leaving aside the payment of substantial ransom such as extending the high-end tax cuts.  With or without payroll tax relief as a core feature, the Republicans will not agree to pass this legislation.  So why would the Administration proceed as if winning their votes was the core design question?  (Actually, I'll suggest a rationale below, but it isn't good enough.)<br /><br />Let's turn our minds back to early 2009 and the big (such as it was) stimulus package.  This included lots of tax breaks that the Administration, through its economists, knew would be less effective than alternative programs.  They put these in to get Republican support.  They got zero Republican support.  They kept the tax breaks in anyway, and then of course grossly oversold an inadequately sized package as providing enough to get the economy back on track.  Then, when the recovery fell far short of the rhetorical expectations that had been created, the Administration had encouraged the retort that stimulus just doesn't work (as opposed to its having been too small).<br /><br />Now once again we have a flurry of proposals that are going to be too small in aggregate and deliberately poorly designed, in the hope of getting Republican support, which they have zero chance of getting.  <br /><br />But why did I title this post \"What would Nixon do?\"  OK, I have keen memories of the old Trickster, though I realize that he is ancient history to anyone under the age of 45.  But bear with me.  One thing we know that Nixon absolutely for sure would have done (because he did it) is use every possible tool he had to push the Fed towards a more stimulative policy.  Obama utterly failed to do this, whether through appointments or private sit-downs or public jawboning.<br /><br />But there is also another standard Nixon trick that, sleazy though it was in context, the Obama Administration ought to think about.  Nixon was a big fan of proposing legislation that he knew couldn't be passed, specifically because if it wasn't passed he would get a campaign issue.  E.g., supposedly in 1970 he was disappointed by his success in getting the Democratic Congress to pass a tough crime bill that contained provisions that, under the quaint standards of the time, were considered odious by civil libertarians.  Nixon had deliberately put these things in the proposed legislation, although they were largely symbolic and expected to have little actual impact on crime, because he wanted the Democrats to refuse to pass the legislation, whereupon he would make it a campaign issue and blame rising crime levels on them.  They took the issue away by acceding.<br /><br />How would such a scenario play out today?  If Nixon faced Obama's current political circumstances, he would not be trying actually to enact stimulus legislation.  He would know that he had zero chance of getting anything that would make a significant difference.  He would want to propose something that the opposition WOULDN'T pass, and that he could then campaign on.  (And it is clear this time around, unlike with the 1970 crime legislation, that the Congress won't accede in order to take away the issue.)<br /><br />We could use a bit of that thinking today.  Why not propose something that is actually big, dramatic, and well-designed?  And why not make reasonable, economically supportable arguments about why and how much it might actually help?  Then Obama could rightly criticize the Republicans and blame the labor market on them when they fail to pass it.<br /><br />This would not just be Nixon-style maneuvering.  It would also help make the correct point that, since at least mid-2009, we have actually been following Republican budget policies and they haven't worked.  As things stand, by repeatedly acceding to them, even in what he proposes, he accepts a state of affairs in which they actually set the policy yet he takes the blame.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Obama is collaborating in basic miseducation of American voters, by adopting all kinds of false or grossly overstated Republican claims about how regulatory burden and budget deficits are responsible for the jobs situation.<br /><br />If people want Republican policies, they will pick Republicans to implement them.  An abler, more courageous, and more farsighted politician than Obama would recognize the importance of laying the intellectual groundwork for good policy over many years.<br /><br />OK, time is short and it's a bit late for all that now.  So admittedly there is one clear political calculation that might explain how Obama is proceeding in his jobs proposal.  If he proposed big infrastructure and public spending ideas to hire lots of workers and help get us out of the doldrums, and the Republicans refused to enact it, at least they would have a very strong case that they were acting in good faith.  Rather than inviting the campaign charge that they are deliberate economic saboteurs, they would be following their own long-enunciated policy preferences in opposing the legislation.  (McConnell has already previewed this by saying they won't enact failed policies, harvesting the legacy of Obama's 2009 overclaiming for the stimulus legislation.)  <br /><br />But even if the Republicans convincingly argued good faith in opposing such a proposal, Obama could still reply that they are wrong, and that they shouldn't be elected in 2012 because they will follow the wrong policies.<br /><br />Don't call it stimulus, of course - call it creating jobs by hiring lots of people to build things that we need.  Don't rely in public rhetoric on Keynesian multipliers that are counter-intuitive.  Force the Republicans to argue that there will be no net job creation due to indirect effects - a freshwater economists' claim that is counter-intuitive wholly apart from whether it is right or wrong (and with the collapse of consumer demand I would say that it is clearly wrong).<br /><br />By instead proposing watered-down, maldesigned, too-small Republican-style jobs legislation, Obama may hope to strengthen the claim that the Republicans are acting in bad faith when they inevitably reject it.  But accusations of bad faith, which he will of course make extremely decorously if at all, will only go so far with the voters - especially once he has conceded that in general we need Republican-style policies, which they of course are the better-situated party to keep on providing.<br /><br />And the reality is even worse.  One lesson that voters might very well draw is that, if Republicans engage in bad faith obstructionism whenever a Democrat is president, we'd damn well better put them in charge so that they will have the right incentives.  It doesn't make them nice people, but if they will make sure that things go worse when they are not officially in power than when they are, voters could very rationally view this as a good reason for electing them.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-7070766623650429223?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/387/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1322, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Obama\u2019s Buffett Rule: Keep Your Eye on Capital Gains", "text": "<p>President Obama didn\u2019t quite get around to saying so when he rolled out his latest deficit reduction plan on Monday,\u00a0but his <a href=\"/posts/external/240/\" target=\"_blank\">Buffett Rule</a>\u2014that no one making more than $1 million should pay a lower tax rate than those in the middle-class\u2014is mostly\u00a0about investment income.</p>\n<p>On average, high income people\u00a0do pay significantly higher tax rates than those lower down the economic food chain. New <a href=\"/posts/external/361/\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> by my Tax Policy Center colleagues show that the tax code is, overall, quite progressive. For instance, those making $10,000 to $20,000 pay on average about 1 percent of their income in federal taxes. \u00a0Those making $75,000 to $100,000 pay an average effective tax rate of about 17 percent, and those who making more than $1 million pay 29 percent. \u00a0(Tax geek note: TPC includes income, payroll, and estate taxes. It also allocates all corporate income tax payments to owners of capital). \u00a0</p>\n<p>So what\u2019s Obama\u2019s problem? His objection\u2014and Buffett\u2019s\u2014is not with rates paid by the average taxpayer who makes a million dollars or more a year (and, yes, I did smile when I wrote that). Rather it is with those in this group (whose income averages about $2.9 million) who make most of their money from investments.</p>\n<p>To see what\u2019s going on, let\u2019s crank up the microscope even more. Look at the very highest income taxpayers\u2014the 0.1 percent who make an average of almost $7 million annually. Typically, they pay about 29 percent of their income in taxes, nearly twice what middle-income earners pay.</p>\n<p>But as my colleague Bob Williams described so well in a TaxVox <a href=\"/posts/external/362/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> a few weeks ago, a few of those very high earners make more than two-thirds of their income from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at just 15 percent. Thanks to those low rates and the astute use of some other tax breaks, they pay very low combined\u00a0income and payroll tax rates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What could Congress do to make sure those investors at the tippy-top of the income scale pay more tax? Not much point in raising their rates on ordinary income to the pre-2001 levels of 39.6 percent since they don\u2019t make much of their money on wages and salary.</p>\n<p>And\u00a0scaling back popular <a href=\"/posts/external/363/\" target=\"_blank\">tax subsidies </a>for, say, mortgage interest and employer-sponsored health insurance won&#8217;t help alot either. Those tax breaks really benefit the upper middle class and the merely rich, not the Buffetts of the world (after all, you can only get so much gold plating on your health insurance and the mortgage deduction is already capped at $1 million). The big guys do\u00a0benefit from big charitable deductions, however.</p>\n<p>That leaves the tax treatment of investments. The chairs of Obama\u2019s fiscal commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, would\u00a0raise\u00a0capital gains rates even as they cut\u00a0rates on ordinary income.\u00a0So would the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>\n<p>Even GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney sees the problem\u2014though through a very different lens than Obama.\u00a0 While Romney would drop the rate on gains and dividends to zero for most taxpayers, those making more than $200,000 would still have to pay at 15 percent.\u00a0I suspect\u00a0he realizes zeroing out investment taxes for all would be a tough sell\u00a0for both revenue and distributional reasons.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And there is one important unanswered question about those high-income investors: Just how much\u00a0tax have they indirectly\u00a0paid on capital that may not be captured in current estimates? TPC is working through that one and hopes to have an answer soon.\u00a0It may be a lot but keep in mind that Buffett didn&#8217;t count it, and the Internal Revenue Service can&#8217;t track it. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whether you think those very high-income investors are <a href=\"/posts/external/364/\" target=\"_blank\">job creators </a>or merely<a href=\"/posts/external/365/\" target=\"_blank\"> fat cats </a>who aren\u2019t paying their own way (or perhaps both) is up to you.

In the fields I write about professionally, I'd have to say I'm grateful, as it's good for business.\n<br />\n<br />A key reason for these failures is that people get lost in the forest and can only see the trees.  They play with models, use math, etcetera, but forget the basic underlying intuitions.  Or, they become prisoners of simplifying assumptions that are often (but not always) useful, and forget that these assumptions should only be used conditionally and when appropriate.\n<br />\n<br />Today's example is Robert Barro, who has a Wall Street Journal op-ed today (available outside the paywall <a href=\"/posts/external/396/\">here</a>) claiming that Keynesian economics, unlike \"regular economics,\" can't possibly make sense.  Thus, with regard to the claim that Food Stamps or unemployment benefits could boost demand and help ease the recession, he concludes:\n<br />\n<br />\"There are two ways to view Keynesian stimulus through transfer programs. It's either a divine miracle\u2014where one gets back more than one puts in\u2014or else it's the macroeconomic equivalent of bloodletting.\"\n<br />\n<br />And elsewhere he says of the at one time uncontroversial Keynesian idea that giving money to the cash-constrained can be stimulative:\n<br />\n<br />\"How can it be right? Where was the market failure that allowed the government to improve things just by borrowing money and giving it to people?\"\n<br />\n<br /><a href=\"/posts/external/397/\">David Glasner</a> responds to Barro as follows:\n<br />\n<br />\"But wait a second.  What does Barro mean by his query:  'Where was the market failure that allowed the government to improve things just by borrowing money and giving it to people?'  Where is the market failure?  Hello.  Real GDP is at least 10% below its long-run growth trend, the unemployment rate has been hovering between 9 and 10% for over two years, and Professor Barro can\u2019t identify any market failure?\"\n<br />\n<br />Glasner then asks whether Barro agrees with the real business cycle theorists who explained that the Great Depression merely reflected millions of workers' rational decision to take a nice long vacation until productivity and therefore wages were higher.\n<br />\n<br /><a href=\"/posts/external/398/\">Paul Krugman</a> jumps in as well, and mentions some of the standard points from Keynesian economics for which there is empirical evidence, such as sticky prices and wages.\n<br />\n<br />But I have long thought it reasonably clear (as discussed somewhere in <a href=\"/posts/external/399/\">here</a>) that a very familiar tool can do a lot of the work here - collective action problems.  Economic models often simplify the world, and in the right setting with good reason, by taking people's preferences as given and assuming away interdependence.  But suppose I am deciding whether to spend money on a nice vacation.  Even in an entirely rational setting and with a flexibly responding price system, this may depend on how well I expect my business to do over the next few years.  Suppose people who are considering whether to patronize my business have exactly the same thought in mind.  Their willingness to buy goods and services depends importantly on their confidence that others will be buying their own goods or services.  So, when everyone gets scared or anxious, there is a coordination problem.  If only everyone could agree to shake hands and continue opening their wallets a bit, the problem would ease, but instead it feeds on itself, as belt-tightening here prompts responsive belt-tightening there.\n<br />\n<br />To throw in another common buzzword, there's an externality here, as each individual's belt-tightening causes others to lean more towards belt-tightening, creating collectively self-fulfilling prophecies about low earnings potential.\n<br />\n<br />Against this background, Food Stamps and unemployment benefits, by getting people to spend more (albeit perhaps more because they were cash-constrained than due to the vacation problem above) can get things moving in the other direction.  People whose businesses start doing better change their estimats about how much it makes sense for them to spend, and things may start going the other way.\n<br />\n<br />Back in January 2009, Barro had a <a href=\"/posts/external/400/\">WSJ op-ed </a>that was almost as skeptical about stimulus, in which he said:\n<br />\n<br />\"[Keynesian theory] implicitly assumes that the government is better than the private market at marshaling idle resources to produce useful stuff. Unemployed labor and capital can be utilized at essentially zero social cost, but the private market is somehow unable to figure any of this out. In other words, there is something wrong with the price system.\"\n<br />\n<br />Seen through the above lens, however, the price system in a recession or depression may be getting it exactly right so far as revealed preferences are concerned.  Resources are idle because there isn't enough demand for the production that is being forgone. And given all that the price system is working just fine.\n<br />\n<br />But the seemingly efficient equilibrium is far inferior in human welfare terms to the alternative one that would result if people could coordinate shifting to a higher-expressed demand, higher-output equilibrium.\n<br />\n<br />This presumably is what Glasner means when he says: \"Hello. Real GDP is at least 10% below its long-run growth trend, the unemployment rate has been hovering between 9 and 10% for over two years, and Professor Barro can\u2019t identify any market failure?\"\n<br />\n<br />And this is why the view that the Great Depression was just a nice long holiday, as people awaited higher productivity that would increase their willingness to swap leisure for work, has never seemed very intuitively persuasive.\n<br />\n<br />But the use of collective action problems and externalities that I suggest here lies outside conventions that economists are accustomed to allowing in their models (which commonly take revealed preferences as given rather than conditional and interdependent, and assume away externalities unless clearly demonstrable like that from pollution).  Also, the use I suggest is admittedly a bit informal and ad hoc, which economists may rightly be on guard against.  But it is coherent logically, plausible intuitively, and permits one to make more sense of the world.  Barro's apparent inability to see that it might be relevant, and thus his entirely misplaced sarcasm about whether Keynesian economics could possibly make sense outside the realm of \"divine miracle,\" is more disappointing than surprising.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-468085053753262171?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/401/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1335, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Another of my international tax articles comes out", "text": "My paper \"The Rising Tax-Electivity of U.S. Corporate Residence,\" previously posted here, has now officially come out in the Tax Law Review.  A link to the published version is available <a href=\"/posts/external/301/\">here</a>.\n<br />\n<br />The abstract is as follows:\n<br />\n<br />\"In an increasingly integrated global economy, with rising cross-border stock listings and share ownership, U.S. corporate residence for income tax purposes, which relies on one\u2019s place of incorporation, may become increasingly elective for new equity. Existing equity in U.S. companies, however, is effectively trapped here, given the difficulty of expatriating for tax purposes absent a bona fide acquisition by new owners. \n<br />\n<br />\"Both the prospect of rising tax electivity for new equity and the very different situation facing old U.S. equity have important implications for U.S. international tax policy. This paper therefore explores three main questions: (1) the extent to which U.S. corporate residence actually is becoming elective for new equity, (2) the implications of rising electivity for the age-old (though often mutually misguided) debate between proponents of residence-based worldwide corporate taxation on the one hand and a territorial or exemption system for foreign source income on the other, and (3) the transition issues for old equity if a territorial system is adopted.\"\n<br />\n<br />In addition to the discussion referenced in the abstract, the paper foreshadows and provides a brief exploration of a somewhat bigger topic: what (in my view) is fundamentally wrong with a lot of contemporary academic international tax policy analysis, and what the analysis should instead look like.  Much more on this to come in my book in progress, Fixing the U.S. International Tax Rules.\n<br />\n<br />Some of the building blocks of this analysis also appear in the two main versions of my recent article on foreign tax credits, available <a href=\"/posts/external/393/\">here</a> and <a href=\"/posts/external/394/\">here</a>.

That may be true, but Cantor\u2019s own ideas about cutting taxes would do the same thing.</p>\n<p>The federal income tax deduction for charitable contributions encourages taxpayers to donate to charities by reducing the after-tax cost of giving. If you\u2019re in the 35- percent top tax bracket, for example, giving a dollar costs you only 65 cents because the deduction saves you 35 cents in taxes. The higher your tax rate, the lower your after-tax cost of giving.</p>\n<p>Cantor complained about the president\u2019s proposal to limit the value of the deduction for charitable deductions (and other deductions and some exclusions) to 28 percent. That would raise the cost of giving a dollar to 72 cents because the proposal would cut the tax savings to 28 cents. The higher price of giving would likely induce people to give less (at least in total\u2014we don\u2019t know whether they\u2019d cut their donations to soup kitchens).</p>\n<p>But that logic extends to other proposals to change tax rates. By Cantor\u2019s own logic, tax policies that he supports could also harm soup kitchens by reducing donations. Cutting the top tax rate to 25 percent, for example, would raise the cost of giving to 75 cents per dollar, leading high-income donors to give less. (That reduction would be partly offset by what economists call the \u201cincome effect\u201d\u2014lower taxes raise after-tax incomes, so people give more because they have more to give. But the \u201cprice effect\u201d from raising the cost typically outweighs the income effect.)</p>\n<p>Another example: Allowing the 2001-03 tax cuts to expire for high-income taxpayers, which the president has repeatedly proposed and which Cantor opposes, could help charities. Boosting the top tax rate to 39.6 percent would lower the cost of giving and increase contributions. (Again, an income effect would offset at least some of the gain\u2014higher taxes reduce after-tax income so people give less.)</p>\n<p>In any case, it\u2019s not soup kitchens that should worry about lower donations from the rich. More than 60 percent of donations in 2005 for basic needs came from people with income under $200,000, according to a <a href=\"/posts/external/347/\">2007 study</a> by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. In contrast, more than 80 percent of contributions to health organizations and more than 90 percent of those for education and the arts were from people making more than $200,000. Those groups have a lot more to fear from reduced tax savings for donations.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s silly to complain that cutting tax rates would hurt charities by leading people to give less. But Cantor\u2019s complaint that the president\u2019s plan would go after soup kitchens in perilous economic times is equally silly. Both arguments are true, but both ignore larger points.</p>\n<p>But then what would you expect here in Washington where silly political arguments are always in season?</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/348/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1329, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "New article published on SSRN", "text": "I have just published on SSRN an article draft that I prepared over the summer, entitled Tax Reform Implications of the Risk of a U.S. Budget Catastrophe.<br /><br />The link for downloading the article is <a href=\"/posts/external/379/\">here</a>.<br /><br />The abstract is as follows:<br /><br />\"Despite the demographic causes of the long-term U.S. fiscal gap, only severe dysfunction in our political system, abetted by malfunctioning and discontinuously responsive global financial markets, could lead to a U.S. budget catastrophe.

The threat of a fiscal catastrophe also raises concern about otherwise desirable but potentially revenue-losing reforms, such as to the rules for corporate and international taxation. <br /><br />\"A number of tax instruments not currently used in the U.S. might be appealing even if the reform that included them was revenue-neutral overall. These include a value-added tax (VAT), a carbon tax, and a financial activities tax (FAT), although in my view a financial transactions tax (FTT) would not have comparable merit. All of these instruments potentially gain appeal if they could be used to ease the political prospects for raising overall U.S. tax revenues, and thus for reducing the risk of a budgetary catastrophe.\"<br /><br />A few words in further description: I prepared this short article draft pursuant to my obligations as a speaker at the University of Louisville Law Review Symposium on Federal Budget and Debt Reduction, which will be held at the University of Louisville Law School on Saturday, October 22, from 10 am to 4 pm.

And to do so, they must confront Doug\u2019s choice: Do they do less than many voters expect, tax more, or both?</p>\n<p>To add to the challenge, they are trying to do it at a time when the nation is deeply divided\u2014and conflicted. Polls suggest most Americans support deficit reduction\u2014but oppose the very spending cuts and tax hikes needed to achieve it. This disconnect is not helped by politicians who continue to promise pain-free deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>At the most recent GOP presidential debate, for instance, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich <a href=\"/posts/external/372/\">insisted</a> he could address<br />\nmost fiscal problems by controlling, yes, waste, fraud, and abuse.\u00a0 \u201cAnybody who knows anything about the federal government knows that there\u2019s such an enormous volume of waste, that if you simply had a serious, all-out effort to modernize the federal government, you would have hundreds of billions of dollars of savings falling off,\u201d Gingrich claimed.</p>\n<p>Now, there is plenty of waste in government and we absolutely should curb it. But is it going to fix the deficit problem? Only in Newt\u2019s dreams.</p>\n<p>So increasingly, it looks as if we are going to have an election about the fundamental role of government\u2014in creating jobs,\u00a0helping those in distress, and\u00a0preserving the nation\u2019s health and safety. This may not be so true if Republicans nominate Mitt Romney. But it certainly will be if the GOP picks Texas Governor Rick Perry and Obama sticks with the powerful defense of government he delivered to Congress earlier this month. \u00a0Not since Johnson and Goldwater would these competing visions be so clear. If nothing else, as Goldwater said, voters will have a choice, not an echo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/373/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1326, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Tales from (near) the Vienna Woods", "text": "Last Tuesday night I flew to Vienna to teach a 4-day, 3 hours per day International Tax Policy class to students in a new doctoral program at a tax institute among the economics and business programs at Vienna University.  The students are mostly lawyers, but also include people with degrees in economics, business administration, and someone with accounting as well as law.  We're halfway done now, with a break for the weekend.<br /><br />One of the best things about teaching this class is that there's no exam.  Instead, the students will write papers.  And while it's true that writing exams and grading them are the two worst tasks in a law professor's job, that's not even the main reason it's so incredibly refreshing not to have to do it.<br /><br />I've assigned a bunch of readings (all by me, including unpublished book chapter drafts, except for the Tax Notes versions of Kleinbard's Stateless Income), but I don't feel I have to lecture on them.  If on a given day I think it would be more instructive or fun to discuss X, Y, or Z (provided they are pertinent to the class's topic), that's just fine.  No one is wondering about whether that's on the test, or whether stuff in the readings that I'm not discussing is on the test.<br /><br />Obviously, the danger in such a situation is that the students will be unmotivated.  But apart from the fact that they have to write papers, they're only in this program (3 years, but they're just starting) because they're interested in international business taxation, and in some cases possibly in academics or government policy jobs.  They all have good work experience and would be insane to do this unless they were highly motivated.<br /><br />When I teach the Tax Policy Colloquium at NYU, I get the same benefit of students who can take an interest without having to worry about the exam.  (I of course don't blame students for worrying about exams when given; it just makes the experience much worse both for me and for them, and makes it much less genuinely educational apart from the admittedly important motivation it provides to take a class seriously.)  <br /><br />Of course, the colloquium is 14 weeks long, and the students have lots more going on, including other classes, family life, and job search.  Plus, their opportunity cost is much lower, taking as given that they've decided to go to law school (or to add an LLM degree).  Thus, the average level of commitment in the colloquium is bound to be less.  But this is not to complain - I've been very happy with my colloquium students over the years, and I believe I've had some success, via various measures, in getting enrollees to self-select for being genuinely interested.  It's been a true pleasure to get to know all these students (as one does a bit more in the colloquium than the lecture hall setting), and to learn from as well as teach them.<br /><br />Meanwhile I've been touristing up a storm, so to speak, in Vienna, to the extent that I am feeling run-down and borderline sick.  On Wednesday, after arrival, I went to the Schlossburg Palace & its grounds, including the Vienna Zoo, followed by 3 modern art museums in  a complex called the Museum Quarter, topped off with dinner at one of the stalls in a place called the Naschmarkt (best translated as Nosh Market).<br /><br />On Thursday after class, Demel's and Hotel Sacher's pastry shop followed by the delightful Albertina Museum (also with lots of modern stuff).  I may go to an obscure American film there tomorrow (George Ray Hill's The Driver).<br /><br />On Friday after class, the Kunsthistorische Museum (main Vienna art museum for the Renaissance and surrounding periods) followed by the Natural History Museum, then dinner with my host at a very non-touristy and authentic Vienna restaurant right on the edge of the Vienna Woods.<br /><br />Today I took a train (1 hour each way) to Bratislava, Slovakia for a day trip.  Charming town now that it has recovered from the horrid drabness and failure that the Communists imposed on it.  Lots of charming and deliberately whimsical town squares, a few museums, a castle, some towers, coffee and a pastry on the town square, etcetera.  Bratislava also has the Danube flowing through it, though it looked green rather than blue.  At lunch, a very good Slovakian meal that (along with the pastry that followed) will also serve as my dinner.<br /><br />As it was sunny and nice and everyone around was having a beer, I decided to do so at lunch as well, although that's certainly not my usual practice (too much the puritanical American, I suppose).  Pilsener Urquel was prominently listed on the menu, but I was wondering (since I've heard of it in the US) if it is below the top local standard.  I asked the waitress if it was good, and she frowned and said \"It's Czech.\"  So I got a Slovakian dark beer instead.<br /><br />Tomorrow, another art museum & park called the Belvedere, then maybe that George Roy Hill movie.  This leaves only Monday and Tuesday after class (I leave early on Wednesday).<br /><br />I've brought work here, and I certainly could use the time doing it, but somehow when one's away from one's usual places and also has touring opportunities (cue the Puritanical sense of duty again, I suppose, although I really do enjoy it & find it interesting), I just can't find the motivation to do any of it.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-823613939454059622?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/376/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1317, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Taxes and Energy Policy", "text": "<p><em>Last week I had the opportunity to testify before two\u00a0Ways and Means\u00a0subcommittees&#8211;Select Revenue Measures\u00a0and Oversight&#8211;about the way our tax system is used as a tool of energy policy. Here are my opening remarks. You can find\u00a0<a href=\"/posts/external/349/\">my full testimony here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>As you know, our tax system is desperately in need of reform. It\u2019s needlessly complex, economically harmful, and often unfair. Because of a plethora of temporary tax cuts, it\u2019s also increasingly unpredictable.</p>\n<p>We can and should do better.</p>\n<p>The most promising path to reform is to reexamine the many tax preferences in our code. For decades, lawmakers have used the tax system not only to raise revenues to pay for government activities, but also to pursue a broad range of social and economic policies. These policies touch many aspects of life, including health insurance, home ownership, retirement saving, and the topic of today\u2019s hearing, energy production and use.</p>\n<p>These preferences often support important policy goals, but they have a downside. They narrow the tax base, reduce revenues, distort economic activity, complicate the tax system, force tax rates to be higher than they otherwise would be, and are often unfair. Those concerns have prompted policymakers and analysts across the political spectrum\u2014including, most notably, the Bowles-Simpson commission\u2014to recommend that tax preferences be cut back. The resulting revenue could then be used to lower tax rates, reduce future deficits, or some combination of the two.</p>\n<p>In considering such proposals, lawmakers should consider how tax reform, fiscal concerns, and energy policy interact.\u00a0 Six factors are particularly important.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Our tax system needs a fundamental overhaul.</strong> Every tax provision, including those related to energy, deserves close scrutiny to determine whether its benefits exceed its costs. Such a review will reveal that many tax preferences should be reduced, redesigned, or eliminated.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The code includes numerous energy tax preferences.</strong> The Treasury Department, for example, recently identified 25 types of energy preferences worth about $16 billion in 2011. These include incentives for renewable energy sources, traditional fossil fuel sources, and energy efficiency. In addition, energy companies are also eligible for several tax preferences that are available more broadly, such as the domestic production credit.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tax subsidies are an imperfect way of pursuing energy and environmental policy goals.</strong> Such subsidies do encourage greater use of targeted energy resources. But, as I discuss in greater detail in my written testimony, they do so in an economically wasteful manner. Subsidies require, for example, that the government play a substantial role in picking winners and losers among energy technologies. The associated revenue losses also require higher taxes or larger deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A key political challenge for reform is that energy tax subsidies are often viewed as tax cuts</strong>. It makes more sense, however, to view them as spending through the tax code. Reducing such subsidies would make the government smaller even though tax revenues, as conventionally measured, would increase.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tax subsidies are not created equal</strong>. Production incentives reward businesses for producing desired energy and are agnostic about what mix of capital, labor, and materials firms use to accomplish that. Investment incentives, in contrast, reward businesses merely for making qualifying investments and encourage firms to use relatively more capital than labor. For both reasons, production incentives tend to be more efficient than investment incentives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Well-designed taxes can typically address the negative effects of energy use more effectively and at lower cost than can tax subsidies</strong>. I understand that higher gasoline taxes or a new carbon tax are not popular ideas in many circles, but please bear with me. As I explain at length in my written testimony, well-designed energy taxes are a much more pro-market way of addressing energy concerns than are tax subsidies. Taxes take full advantage of market forces and, in so doing, can accomplish policy goals at least cost and with minimal government intervention. Subsidies, in contrast, make much less use of market forces and inevitably require the government to pick winners and losers. Energy taxes also generate revenue that lawmakers can use to cut other taxes or to reduce deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>P.S. Not surprisingly, that last point wasn&#8217;t picked up by anyone else, at least during my panel (one of three at the\u00a0hearing). New energy taxes would, of course, be problematic for the macroeconomy if enacted immediately. And we&#8217;d have to\u00a0make\u00a0some adjustment, either in the tax code or in benefit programs, to offset the impact on low-income families.\u00a0In the long-run, however, I think that would be a much better way to address many energy concerns, including carbon emissions and oil dependence. But that&#8217;s not the way our system works. Instead,\u00a0as noted, it&#8217;s much more popular to use tax preferences, whose benefits are visible and whose costs are obscure, to pursue energy and environmental goals.

But important new research by career staffers at the Treasury Department <a href=\"/posts/external/352/\">conclude</a>s that there are lots fewer of these firms than many<br />\nthink, they account for only about 17 percent of total business income, and \u00a0hire many fewer workers than the political<br />\nrhetoric would have you to believe.</p>\n<p>Using newly available tax data, the Treasury staff has refined its definition of small business and found there are no more than about 20 million owners of these firms in the U.S.&#8211; far fewer than the 35 million they previously figured. And only about five million have any employees.</p>\n<p>Small businesses take on an outsized importance in the tax policy debate for two reasons: These firms play into the great American entrepreneurial narrative and, in the current political debate, they are the \u201cjob creators.\u201d Raise their taxes, goes the argument, and you further wreck an already-weak economy by discouraging these firms from hiring and investing.</p>\n<p>Well, it turns out most of the firms those pols define as small businesses don\u2019t hire or invest very much at all. There is no question that other companies whose income is reported on individual tax returns do hire and invest (quite a lot in some cases), but they are not small businesses, at least not according to this new definition.</p>\n<p>So what is a small business? The Treasury team, led by Matthew Knittel at the Office of Tax Analysis, defined one as a firm that has combined income or deductions of at least $10,000 but no more than $10 million and one that operates in a businesslike manner. In other words, it has expenses such as wages, office supplies, rent, and the like.</p>\n<p>This is very different than the Small Business Administration, which uses multiple definitions but can include firms with sales of\u00a0as much as $35.5 million with as many as 1,500 employees. It also is an effort to distinguish between those who report business income on their <a href=\"/posts/external/353/\" target=\"_blank\">individual returns </a>and actual small businesses. Treasury finds that many partnerships, S corporations, and others who file on an individual return don\u2019t meet the small business test\u2014either because they make too much money to be \u201csmall\u201d or too little to be a real business.</p>\n<p>Those distinctions are extremely important since many politicians love nothing more than to happily label all firms whose owners report income on their individual returns as iconic small businesses. If nothing else, the Treasury staff analysis shows how bogus that exercise is.</p>\n<p>For example, using tax year 2007 data, Treasury found that of the 23.2 million people who reported income on Schedule C, fewer than half met its small business test\u2014nearly all because they were too small. On average, the excluded firms reported just $7,000 of total income and $4,600 of net income.</p>\n<p>About small business as job creators: Treasury found that only about 5.4 million small businesses paid any wages at all. Of the more than 10 million with income of less than $100,000, only about 10 percent paid any wages, and about half that compensation went to owners and other officers.</p>\n<p>This picture of small businesses is vastly different from the image presented by many politicians\u2014and casts the debate over how these firms are taxed in a very different light. Knittel and his colleagues acknowledge there are other ways to measure these businesses, but conclude that most competing definitions tell roughly the same story they do.</p>\n<p>Congress would do well to get its facts right. But unfortunately, when it comes to rhetoric about small business, lawmakers seem to prefer their own version of don\u2019t-ask-don\u2019t-tell.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/354/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1319, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Deadlines, Deadlines, Deadlines", "text": "<p><em><a href=\"/posts/external/355/\">My latest column\u00a0</a>for the Christian Science Monitor argues that a slew of budget deadlines will drive policy action this Fall.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely, at least not yet, but such deadlines will be the big thing this fall:</em></p>\n<p>September brings the change of seasons. Football players return to the gridiron. New television programs replace summer reruns. In Washington, legislators gear up for another season of legislative brinkmanship.</p>\n<p>What distinguishes such brinkmanship from ordinary legislating? Hard deadlines.</p>\n<p>Such deadlines force Congress to address policy issues that might otherwise languish due to partisan differences or legislative inertia.</p>\n<p>Last spring, for example, the repeated threat of a government shutdown forced Congress to decide how much to spend on government agencies in fiscal 2011. This summer, the debt limit forced Republicans and Democrats to reach a budget compromise before Aug. 3, the day we would have discovered what happens if America can\u2019t pay all its bills.</p>\n<p>Hard deadlines thus can force Congress to address major issues. But they also invite that brinkmanship.</p>\n<p>Like students who put off writing term papers until the night before they\u2019re due, legislators often drag out negotiations until the very end. As we saw with the debt-limit debate, the ensuing uncertainty \u2013 will the United States really default? \u2013 can damage consumer, business, and international confidence. Hard deadlines also give leverage to those legislators who are least concerned about going over the brink.</p>\n<p>So get ready for the new season. The fall legislative season is full of deadlines that could invite such brinkmanship. Here are five.</p>\n<p><em>[The first two were funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, whose short-term funding was scheduled to expire on September 16 and the highway bill, whose funding was scheduled to expire on September 30. Both won temporary extensions between the time I wrote my column and when it appeared online. FAA funding now runs to January, and highway funding\u00a0through March.] \u2026</em></p>\n<p>Sept. 30 also marks the end of the fiscal year \u2013 an especially important deadline. Congress has made woefully little progress in deciding next year\u2019s funding. So we again face the prospect of temporary funding bills being negotiated in the shadow of threatened government shutdowns.</p>\n<p>The fourth deadline comes on Nov. 23, the day the new \u201csuper committee\u201d has to deliver a plan to address government debt and cut the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over the next decade. If any seven committee members agree by that date, their plan will get special, expedited consideration in the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>If the committee fails to reach agreement or Congress fails to enact it by Dec. 23, however, then automatic budget cuts go into effect for a range of programs, including defense, domestic programs, and Medicare, starting in 2013.</p>\n<p>A final deadline comes at the end of the year, when several economic initiatives are set to expire, including the 2 percent payroll tax holiday and extended unemployment insurance benefits.</p>\n<p>Each of these deadlines will command congressional attention. The downside of inaction will be tangible and visible. With renewed concern about jobs, policymakers will feel extra pressure to continue any funding or tax cuts that can be directly linked to employment.</p>\n<p>These deadline-driven policy issues will thus dominate the fall legislative season. That will leave little space for any new initiatives that don\u2019t come with a deadline.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/356/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1320, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Retracting Some Recent Estimates", "text": "<p>On September 21, TPC published several tables (<a href=\"/posts/external/357/\">T11-0359 through 0362</a>) that examine how effective tax rates vary within income groups.

The proportion of people in poverty (15.1 percent) reached its second highest point since 1965, and the proportion of people living in deep poverty (half the poverty level) was the highest level since 1975 \u2013 6.7 percent. The poverty line equaled $17,568 for a single parent with two children. The official income counted to determine poverty is money income before taxes and tax credits. It excludes capital gains and non-cash benefits (so Temporary Assistance for Needy Families counts, but food stamps don\u2019t).</p>\n<p>For some families, tax credits boost income significantly. In 2010, the biggest credits were the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Child Tax Credit (CTC), and the Making Work Pay credit (MWP). The first two assist families with children almost exclusively. Individuals without children get only <a href=\"/posts/external/359/\">about 3 percent of EITC benefits</a>\u00a0 and they get nothing from the CTC. In contrast, MWP provided benefits to all workers and their spouses, regardless of whether or not they have children, but it expired at the end of 2010. In 2011, MWP was replaced with a payroll tax cut that is scheduled to expire at the end of 2011, but President Obama has proposed expanding it and extending it.</p>\n<p>Although tax credits encourage work and subsidize low wages for families with children, they do little for low-income childless families. In 2010, a single parent with two children with poverty level earnings received a 41-percent income boost ($4,800 EITC, $2,000 CTC, and $400 MWP). At half-poverty, the subsidy jumps to 54 percent ($3,500 EITC, $868 CTC, and $400 MWP). If these credits were counted in the official poverty estimate, they would lift many working families out of poverty \u2013 and we ought to protect that piece of the social safety net now.</p>\n<p>But today\u2019s tax credits don\u2019t give full benefits to all poor households. Individuals must have earnings\u2014sometimes substantial earnings\u2014to benefit from any of these credits. \u00a0Families must have at least $3,000 of earnings to get the CTC, for example, and a family with two children doesn\u2019t receive its full $2,000 child credit until earnings exceed $16,333. Phasing the CTC in from the first dollar of earnings\u2014as the EITC and MWP do\u2014would give a $1,318 CTC to a family earning just $8,784 (the threshold for a family of 3 in deep poverty). Alternatively, a higher phase-in rate would deliver the full credit at lower earnings level. In any case, none of the three tax credits provides benefits to individuals who are not working.</p>\n<p>In budget talks, policy makers must not only protect the low-income assistance now offered through the tax system, but must also make sure there\u2019s not a gaping hole at the bottom, like what we now have for childless individuals. The Super Committee should be motivated by these continued high poverty rates and use this opportunity to provide a sufficient safety net for everyone.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/360/", "publication_date": "2011-09-30 18:59:29", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1311, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Off to Oxford tomorrow", "text": "Never a dull moment.

As a matter of economics, this is incorrect.<br /><br />Standard economic models of tax incidence show that, at equilibrium, it doesn't matter whether you change the tax hit on the employer side or the employee side, because that only affects legal incidence, without transforming the factors that determine economic incidence.  But in the short run (i.e, in transition to the equilibrium), it unmistakably DOES matter which side you do it on.<br /><br />Suppose wages are sticky in the short run, whether for psychological reasons reflecting nominal prices or simply because people have existing short-term contracts.  For example, suppose I have a contract with my employer specifying that it will pay me $12 per hour through the end of the year.  This is undoubtedly an incomplete contract - it doesn't provide, for example, that this is conditioned on assuming continuation of current payroll tax policy, such that we will agree to the same \"true\" after-tax wage no matter which side Congress might pick for a payroll tax holiday.  If the payroll tax is cut on the employee side, I pocket the increased after-tax income.  No renegotiation until the next go-round (where it would more likely occur if the holiday were ongoing or expected to recur)  Likewise, if the payroll tax is suspended on the employer side, it pcokets the extra change.<br /><br />True, supply and demand are going to be affected, but the point is that to a considerable degree all this takes time to unfold.<br /><br />So while Doug is likely right about permanently changing the payroll tax on one side or the other (leaving aside details such as the fact that minimum wage laws don't adjust for payroll tax nominal incidence), he is clearly wrong about the economics of, say, another one-year payroll tax holiday that is enacted with little advance notice and great uncertainty in advance about whether it would in fact happen.<br /><br />There's a distributional difference in who pockets the money, and also a stimulative difference since the workers may on average have higher marginal propensity to consume than the owners of the businesses that would pocket the transition gain the other way around.<br /><br />To be sure, it's still a far-from-great stimulus choice, given that even the richest workers get the payroll tax holiday as to their wages up to the Social Security tax cap, plus the fact that high-earners get more than those earning less than the cap amount.<br /><br />I also realize that it's not going to happen, as the Republicans have finally located a class of tax cuts that they don't like - those that would be potentially stimulative in the run-up to 2012.<br /><br />But nonetheless, let's try to discuss it honestly without misapplying standard economics truisms (about long-term incidence) outside their proper realm of application.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-131532569246314573?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/332/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1289, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "A quick comment on corporate tax incidence", "text": "Lee Sheppard has an <a href=\"/posts/external/283/\">article</a> in today's Tax Notes that riffs off Mitt Romney's \"corporations are people\" comment last week to address corporate tax incidence.\n<br />\n<br />Lee criticizes economic models suggesting that labor bears the main burden of the corporate tax, in part by stating:\n<br />\n<br />\"It has even become fashionable to say that labor bears something like 40 to 80 percent of the economic burden of the corporate income tax. This defies common sense. We know that because if labor bore such a significant share of the corporate income tax, corporate managers would not devote so much time and effort to fighting it.\"\n<br />\n<br />Here's why I believe Lee is wrong about this.  The incidence claims are about the long-term difference between equilibria.  For example, suppose a country raises its corporate tax rate, within a couple of years this reduces the amount of capital that would otherwise have been invested in the country, and this in turn causes wages to be lower than they would otherwise have been.  Proof of the causation in this sequence would demonstrate that labor was bearing some of the corporate tax increase via the wage effect.\n<br />\n<br />In politics, however, people mainly care about short-term transition effects.  Thus, suppose that today (without any prior anticipation of this happening) we simply repealed the corporate tax.  Ignoring the deficit problems that this would cause, along with the rampant avoidance of the individual income tax that it would empower, who would be the big transition winners?  Obviously, shareholders at the moment that the change occurred (or rather was announced) would get a huge increase in share value from eliminating all company-level income tax liability.  Managers no doubt would win big-time as well.  Meanwhile, wages for the most part would not change immediately.\n<br />\n<br />This not only explains the observable political alignment on corporate tax issues, but is entirely consistent or reconcilable with the long-term incidence story that focuses on labor and wages.\n<br />\n<br />Lee also complains in her article about a recent vote by the American Economic Association not to require disclosure of funding sources.  She believes that private funding has undermined the objectivity of research, along with intellectual balance in the corporate and international tax fields.  Treading carefully here, as I am on friendly terms both with her and with some of the people whom she might conceivably have in mind, let me just say that I agree this is a serious problem, which cannot be dismissed simply by defending people's good faith and/or incentive to preserve their own intellectual reputations.  What is more, from conversations I have had with a variety of people, I can definitively say that many in the field share Lee's concern, including people who do academic research and/or are not fully on her side in the underlying debates.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-2986279945120879653?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/284/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1290, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Death of Bernard Wolfman", "text": "I'm saddened by the death of emeritus Harvard tax law prof Bernard Wolfman, whom I had gotten to know at HLS conferences, and whom I always enjoyed seeing again.\n<br />\n<br />On the academic side of things, the two articles of his that I know best - both diatribes, but in each case justifiably so - are (1) an attack on the Supreme Court's egregious Frank Lyon decision (which upheld a sale-leaseback tax shelter, based on a silly list of 23 factors and a bizarre insistence that 3-party deals are inherently better than 2-party deals), and (2) a critique of Justice William Douglas' tax jurisprudence, which bizarrely switched, I believe it was in 1948, from being routinely pro-government to anti-government (except for one subsequent case, called P.G. Lake, in which Douglas apparently decided that he hated oil company executives even more than the IRS).\n<br />\n<br />Each has some apparent back story.  In the Frank Lyon article, I believe one can discern that Wolfman was unhappy on ethical grounds about the behavior of the renowned Erwin Griswold, a tax prof who had been his colleague (and the Harvard Law School Dean) not to mention Solicitor General of the U.S., and who thus carried some clout when he represented the taxpayer before the Supreme Court.  In this case, Griswold seems not to have done his best to inform the Supreme Court accurately of the tax stakes in the case (which pertained to tax rate differences, since one of the parties had tax losses that made depreciation deductions unusable).  In the Douglas article, Wolfman does not try to explain the reason for the 1948 change of heart, but I wouldn't be surprised if he knew a story that the late Walter Blum once told me, to the effect that Douglas changed sides in tax cases after he was audited, apparently in relation to reimbursements for his wife's travel expenses when he gave speeches.  I've never tried to check out this story, but Douglas actually has a somewhat foolish dissent in a case involving this issue that is in my co-authored Tax I casebook. If true, however, bad move by the IRS but not very edifying so far as Douglas is concerned.\n<br />\n<br />One part of Bernie's career that may not be well-known, but that he once told me about at dinner, pertained to his service in World War II.  He was in an infantry division on the German front after D-Day, and apparently would have been right at the spot where the Germans attacked in the Battle of the Bulge, except that he was evacuated a few days beforehand due to severe frostbite in his feet.  This he attributed to the fact that the U.S. Army, trying to be thrifty, gave its soldiers on the German front - in the middle of what was apparently one of the coldest winters there in the 20th century - footwear that had been designed for fighting in the scorching deserts of North Africa.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-7149636521235314615?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/285/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1291, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Warren Buffett on taxing the rich", "text": "Warren Buffett has drawn considerable attention with his <a href=\"/posts/external/286/\">op-ed</a> in Monday's NYT suggesting that tax rates be increased for people at the top of the income distribution:\n<br />\n<br />\"Last year my federal tax bill \u2014 the income tax I paid, as well as payroll taxes paid by me and on my behalf \u2014 was $6,938,744. That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 percent of my taxable income \u2014 and that\u2019s actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office. Their tax burdens ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent....\n<br />\n<br />\"But for those making more than $1 million \u2014 there were 236,883 such households in 2009 \u2014 I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more \u2014 there were 8,274 in 2009 \u2014 I would suggest an additional increase in rate. \n<br />\n<br />\"My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It\u2019s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.\"\n<br />\n<br />Some on the right gibe that, if Buffett wants to pay more to the federal government, that's fine; he can do so any time he likes by making a voluntary donation.  But Buffett wants people in his income tier generally to pay more tax, not just himself personally, so the critique is wide of the mark.  He can't unilaterally achieve the social effects of a higher tax rate on rich people generally all by himself, and it's not especially selfish to ask \"Why should I be the only one to pay more?\"  Perhaps it's equally wide of the mark on the same ground, however, when people on the left complain that those on the right shouldn't take advantage of government subsidies that they argue should be repealed.\n<br />\n<br />As I discussed in my recent Tax Notes <a href=\"/posts/external/287/\">article</a>, the policy Buffett advocates of imposing significantly graduated rates at high income levels is in tension with what long was the predominant view suggested by the optimal income tax or OIT literature (which takes distributional concerns into account, not just efficiency).  But that consensus is increasingly vanishing, even within the OIT framework.  I noted this (and some reasons for the change in views) in my article, and since then the Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez's have further spelled out some of the main arguments in <a href=\"/posts/external/288/\">The Case for a Progressive Tax: From Basic Research to Policy Recommendations</a>.\n<br />\n<br />Before one swoon too much over Buffett's nobility (though I do indeed find his stance praiseworthy), a caustic comment from <a href=\"/posts/external/289/\">David Miller </a>may be in order.  David notes that Buffett's \"Berkshire Hathaway stock appreciated by $3 billion last year and, unless he is extraordinarily patriotic, there will never be any income tax paid on his unrealized appreciation. So his tax rate on the economic income he earned last year is more like 0.22% ($6.9/$3.039.9). Even if his tax rate on recognized income was increased to 100%, the tax on his economic income would be a little more than 1% ($39.9/$3.039.9).  A mark-to-market tax on appreciation at a 15% rate would have raised $450 million in 2010 from Warren Buffett alone!\"\n<br />\n<br />David is the author of <a href=\"/posts/external/290/\">A Progressive System of Mark-to-Market Taxation</a>, under which current year mark-to-market taxation of publicly traded securities such as Berkshire Hathaway stock would indeed be required, so this is no idle or random suggestion.  Buffett presumably will never pay tax on the appreciation due to Code section 1014, which gives assets a tax-free basis step-up at death.\n<br />\n<br />On the other side of the ledger, it is certainly fair to note that Berkshire Hathaway appears to pay tax at something like a 30 percent rate on its financial accounting income, if I am correctly interpreting <a href=\"/posts/external/291/\">this</a>.  I myself would count this as paid by Buffett, to the extent of his stock ownership.  While there are disputes about the economic incidence of the corporate tax, similar questions could be raised about non-corporate business taxes that the owners pay directly.\n<br />\n<br />I myself, if generally empowered to specify tax code changes, would opt both for corporate integration (so that Buffett wouldn't be taxed at two levels on BH's income - though, as it happens, I would prefer to concentrate the tax liability at the shareholder level, without regard to the payment of dividends) and for greater high-end rate progressivity.\n<br />\n<br />Another point well known to those who have been following the budget debate, but perhaps worth mentioning here, is that solving the long-term U.S. fiscal gap realistically requires not just revenue increases from the top end of the income distribution, but extending significantly down the income scale to at least the middle-middle.  With an aging population and retirement programs that serve important social purposes (and also are baked in to people's behavior and expectations), raising taxes just at the top will not be sufficient.  But raising them at the top as part of the short-term budgetary response (if anything happens from the Gang of Twelve deliberations) would certainly be a start.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-3544546837951289361?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/292/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1292, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "If Obama were shrewd ...", "text": "... then, instead of denouncing the S & P downgrade (tempting though that must be given their embarrassing track record and the $2 trillion computational blunder), he would have said \"Yes, it's terrible that the Republicans have caused this.

S & P's willingness to downgrade, as a bid to enhance their \"brand,\" is evidence that they think people in the audience for their performance will consider the downgrade credible.  So if I am in the bond market, it is a bit of a Keynes beauty contest thing - someone with a real (reputational) stake has decided that others who are in the bond market will view this as a credibility-enhancing play.  Note that pessimists may not directly participate in the market as much as optimists if the market is incomplete because it is costly to go short.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I'd be unsurprised if there is no market response to the downgrade.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-7875196810510565893?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/296/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1295, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Obama's next two chances to capitulate", "text": "Both are set for September 30, when House Republicans can both cause a government shutdown (as <a href=\"/posts/external/297/\">Stan Collender</a> explains) and force the gas tax to expire unless whatever demands they can think of are met.<br /><br />By the way, there is no need to limit these demands to spending cuts.

So, when we see overwhelming evidence of egregious and pathetic political failure by the Obama White House, there is no shortage of theories defending them (or at least saying that their political ineptitude was, as an appeals court might say in affirming a trial court judgment, harmless error).<br /><br />Theory One is that he wanted more spending cuts than Democrats are comfortable with.  So the Republicans gave him cover.  As in: \"See what they're making me do?\"<br /><br />Verdict: True that he had this motivation.  Perhaps even true that it influenced his feckless negotiating \"strategy.\"  But surely he did not want to get rolled, and so publicly and humiliatingly rolled, by the utter failure of his oft-repeated insistence on getting revenues as well as spending cuts.  So bottom line: False.<br /><br />Theory Two is that he simply had a weak hand to play.  Sure, he might not have played it well, but even a competent politician and negotiator wouldn't have done much better.<br /><br />Verdict: 100% false.  The public supported his preference for \"balanced\" cuts and tax increases.  Now, admittedly, public opinion is often close to irrelevant in Washington.  But he had a decent hand and failed to play it.  Point one: the constitutional option and related gambits, all of which would have gained support from Washington's beloved \"strong leadership\" meme.  Point two: skillful politicians can do much better with hands that are much worse than what he had here.  Think Clinton in 1995 after he lost the 1994 election.  Or for that matter consider the Republicans taking him on in 2009.  If either had performed as abysmally as he did, people would have said: \"They just had a bad hand.  Nobody could have won with that.\"<br /><br />Just because he lost doesn't mean he had an inevitably losing hand.  In many ways it was a good hand.<br /><br />Theory Three is that he's cleverly positioning himself in the center, and letting the Republicans be seen as extremists.<br /><br />Verdict: Mostly false.  People also respect strength, commitment, self-confidence, and success.  His pathetic showing is not going to win him the 2012 election.  He's disheartened his base, millions of whom will likely stay home.  Clinton positioned the Republicans as extremist (when they weren't nearly as far around the bend as they are today) without making himself look like a pathetic loser.<br /><br />The evidence that Obama has very little understanding of the most basic political tactics and strategy is pretty overwhelming.  This is a guy who believes that you start a negotiation by offering LESS than you want, not more so that you can give ground and still do well overall.<br /><br />Jon Stewart had some rather obvious fun with the December press conference clip where he said that of course the Republicans wouldn't risk the full faith and credit of  the U.S. government, so there was no need to negotiate a debt ceiling deal back then.  And for the past 6 months his minions have apparently been telling reporters that of course the Republicans will agree to new revenues, because reasonable people can't disagree that it's part of the problem.<br /><br />He also appears to be strangely arrogant and uneducable about his woefully naive view of political competition.  The Bourbons famously \"learned nothing and forgot nothing.\"  Obama will evidently learn nothing and forget everything.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-4687567113351186479?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/299/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1297, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Recent talk at Oxford summer symposium", "text": "I recently <a href=\"/posts/external/300/\">noted</a> here my trip to Oxford in early July to present a paper and otherwise participate in an international tax conference.

Tax collector bonds help protect against potentially unruly tax officials in five key ways.<br />\n<h3>1. Tax collector bonds are legally binding contracts.</h3>Tax collector bonds function as do other <a href=\"/posts/external/340/\">surety bonds</a>. Each bond that's executed provides a financial guarantee that a specific job will be done according to applicable regulations. Tax collector bonds bind three separate entities together in a legally binding contract.<br />\n<ul><li><strong>The principal</strong> is the tax collector that purchases the bond as a promise that work will be completed appropriately.</li>\n<li><strong>The obligee</strong> is the entity that requires the principal to purchase a bond as a way to deter fraud and potential financial loss.</li>\n<li><strong>The surety</strong> is the insurance company or specialty surety agency that issues the bond as a financial guarantee of the tax collector's ability to do the job.</li>\n</ul><h3>2. Tax collector bonds protect consumer interests.</h3>As a specific type of surety bond, tax collector bonds provide protection to consumers. They're primarily used to guarantee the general public that hired or elected tax collecting officials will perform their duties appropriately. Government agencies establish surety bond regulations to deter fraudulent or otherwise unethical individuals from getting the position.<br />\n<h3>3. Tax collector bonds deter unqualified individuals from getting control of taxpayer money.</h3>Before surety providers issue tax collector bonds, they always conduct thorough background checks of all applicants. To determine a tax collector's credibility, surety providers investigate <a href=\"/posts/external/341/\">the applicant's credit scores</a>, financial records and work histories. Negative feedback will deter sureties from issuing a bond, as they tend to avoid bonding potentially risky principals.<br />\n<h3>4. Tax collector bonds guarantee that collectors will do their job appropriately.</h3>Because tax collectors have access to a significant amount of taxpayer money, they need to be held accountable for their actions. If a tax collector fails to complete the duties of that position according to law, tax collector bonds provide a safety net for the governing agency. This prevents tax collectors from taking advantage of their position's power.<br />\n<h3>5. Tax collector bonds provide compensation if a tax collector should break the law.</h3>If a tax collector breaks the law or otherwise fails to perform duties, tax collector bonds allow obligees or other harmed parties to collect on the bond.  This enables government agencies and the general public to recover funds that were lost as a result of a tax collector's negligence.<br />\n<br />\n<em>This article was provided by Kristen Bradley of <a href=\"/posts/external/342/\">SuretyBonds.com</a>, a nationwide surety bond producer.

But wait a minute. Discretionary spending is appropriated spending. Congress can cut appropriations through the budget process anytime it wants. Why not just \u2026 do it? How is it a big win to declare a commitment to do it over a decade to come?<br /><br />\"The answer to that last is that the ordinary budget process requires some cooperation with the Senate and the president. And it was that cooperation that stuck in House Republicans\u2019 craw. The big benefit of the Boehner plan is that it is seen to be imposed \u2013 and the current GOP mindset is that it\u2019s better to gain less by show of force than to get more by negotiation.\"<br /><br />This is what it comes down to.  The Republicans' core goal has very little to do with policy, but rather is to impose a humiliating surrender on Obama and the Democrats.  Meanwhile, the Democrats are more than willing to surrender in policy terms, even though the American public (unlike the Democrats themselves) takes the Democrats' side substantively (e.g., with regard to the mix between tax and spending changes).  But the Democrats don't want to accept crushing humiliation in the form (as opposed to the content) that the final agreement takes.<br /><br />Over this dispute - whether the Republicans should be allowed to openly humiliate the Democrats - we face the threat of an economic disaster that could be <a href=\"/posts/external/310/\">ten times worse than what happened in 2008</a>.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-5639176855852875304?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/311/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1302, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Shorter John Boehner", "text": "Lindbergh guilty of the child's death because he dragged his feet paying the ransom.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-3230214931877110658?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/312/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1303, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Sleeping in high places", "text": "<a href=\"/posts/external/313/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5633006179003420898\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-69RiFBhCtkg/Tix1Rl0UUOI/AAAAAAAAAOg/TzX5VCtO718/s200/photo.JPG\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand; width: 150px; height: 200px;\" /></a><br />Ursula is owling again, as we call it, and also having a nap.

THIS IS JUST A VACUOUS SOP TO REPUBLICANS, WHO I DON'T THINK WILL BE IMPRESSED.<br /><br />\"Reform, not eliminate, tax expenditures for health, charitable giving, homeownership, and retirement, and retain support for low-income workers and families.\"  ALREADY BACKING OFF THEIR SUPPOSED KEY REVENUE SOURCE.

WHAT ABOUT THE U.S. MULTINATIONALS' TRANSITION GAIN FROM SHIFTING TO EXEMPTION GIVEN THEIR $1.2 TRILLION OR MORE OF FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE?  AND AGAIN, WHERE ARE THE TAX INCREASES?  FOR EXAMPLE, DO THEY PLAN TO COMBINE MAKING CORPORATE DEPRECIATION LESS GENEROUS AS A PAY-FOR WITH BEING MORE PRO-GROWTH? AND WHAT ABOUT U.S. COMPANIES' ABILITY TO REPORT U.S. PROFITS AS ARISING IN TAX HAVENS?  NO WORD OF ADDRESSING THAT.<br /><br />To some extent, I think the disingenuous gobbledygook here (to put it unkindly) reflects a deliberate, well-meaning, and not entirely foolish strategy.  E.g., the thought may be that if Republicans were to agree in principle to raising revenues relative to the baseline in which the Bush tax cuts are extended, one huge obstacle to the revenue-raising changes would have been eliminated.  But I consider it naive to think that this would actually work.  Once the rubber hit the road, the Republicans  would go right back to their anti-tax absolutism.  And even if they didn't, the taxpayers affected by particular revenue-raising proposals would continue to make the task impossible.<br /><br />Hard though it might be - and I admittedly don't think that ANYTHING will work politically; our system is just too dysfunctional - I think you have to try to lead with a bit more of the bad news, rather than leaving it all for later.

They&#8211;and Warren Buffett&#8211;are offended that\u00a0 the rich\u00a0pay relatively low tax rates even though their share of\u00a0 national income (and wealth) is growing.</p>\n<p>With this discordant rhetoric in mind, let\u2019s take a look at who benefits most from three popular tax subsidies:</p>\n<p><strong>The Earned Income Tax Credit</strong>: This refundable credit is aimed at providing cash assistance to low-income\u00a0working families. Not surprisingly, 80 percent of the<a href=\"/posts/external/236/\" target=\"_blank\"> benefit </a>goes to households\u00a0 making between $10,000 and $40,000\u2014about 40 percent of all tax units. Even in\u00a0 those income ranges, only about one in four families get the credit. The\u00a0 average benefit for an EITC\u00a0household making $20,000-$30,000 is more than $3,000. Not\u00a0 a lot if you run a hedge fund, but a 12 percent boost in your after-tax income \u00a0if you are making the minimum wage.\u00a0 Almost no-one who makes more than $75,000\u00a0receives any benefit from the earned-income credit.</p>\n<p><strong>The Charitable Deduction</strong>: In many ways, it is the mirror image of the EITC. Almost no households\u00a0making less than $50,000 get any <a href=\"/posts/external/237/\" target=\"_blank\">tax benefit </a>at all from the charitable\u00a0deduction. It is not because they are not generous givers\u2014this group gave about\u00a0 3.5 percent of their income in 2009, more than the 2.4 percent contributed by\u00a0those making $100,000 or more.\u00a0 Instead,\u00a0it\u2019s because they can only take the deduction if they itemize, and most households\u00a0don\u2019t. But while only 3 percent of the benefit of the charitable deduction goes\u00a0to those making less than $50,000, nearly 85 percent goes to those making\u00a0$100,000 or more, and more than one-quarter goes to the 0.3 percent of\u00a0households making $1 million or more.</p>\n<p><strong>The mortgage interest deduction</strong>:\u00a0 While the EITC mostly\u00a0helps low-wage working families and the charitable deduction is a windfall\u00a0for the highest-earners, the mortgage interest deduction<a href=\"/posts/external/238/\" target=\"_blank\"> targets </a>most of its\u00a0benefit to the middle-class and the rich\u2014but not the super-rich. More than 40 percent of the benefit goes to those making between $100,000 and $200,000, and two-thirds goes to those making $100,000 to\u00a0$500,000. Those making less than $50,000 get less than 4.5 percent of the tax break, even though they represent two-thirds of all tax units.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that I\u2019m only talking about tax benefits here. There is no doubt, for example, that some low-income families benefit from the\u00a0help of non-profits that are supported by tax-deductible charitable giving.</p>\n<p>Still the lesson is\u00a0clear: Not all tax subsidies are created equal. And many are not loopholes at all. But whatever you call them, the economic effects and the politics of each are very different. So next time you hear a politician pontificate about loophole-closers or revenue-raisers, you might want to ask just exactly what he or she is talking about.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/239/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1280, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Was Buffett Right? Do Workers Pay More Tax than Their Bosses?", "text": "<p>When Warren Buffett called for higher taxes on the wealthy in <a href=\"/posts/external/240/\">a New York Times op-ed</a> last week, the billionaire investor argued that he and wealthy people like him face lower federal rates than the rest of us. Low rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends and limited exposure to payroll taxes mean low taxes for the rich, he asserted, while more typical workers don\u2019t get those breaks. He\u2019s right on many of his points but not about the rich paying less tax (relative to income) than average\u2014or even well off\u2014taxpayers.</p>\n<p>First, what did Buffett get right? Taxpayers who get lots of income from capital gains and dividends pay less tax than those who earn most of their income from wages. People who get all of their income from long-term capital gains and qualified dividends will never pay a combined federal individual income and payroll tax rate of even 15 percent, no matter how much they make. That\u2019s because the maximum tax on their investment income is 15 percent and they don\u2019t face payroll taxes. (See graph. Note that the graph shows the highest possible tax rate by assuming the taxpayer 1) claims only the standard deduction and personal exemptions; 2) gets no benefit from other deductions, exemptions, exclusions, or tax credits; and 3) bears the cost of both the employer and employee shares of payroll taxes.) </p>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/external/241/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1943\" height=\"348\" src=\"/posts/external/241/\" title=\"Effective-Tax-Rates.8-23-11\" width=\"450\" /></a><br />\nIn contrast, single people who get all their income from wages always pay more than 15 percent once their income hits about $12,500. When their income reaches about $500,000, their combined tax approaches 38 percent. The same story applies to married couples, although their effective tax rate is always less than that for singles if only one spouse works. At any total income level, you will always pay a higher tax rate if your income comes in the form of wages than if it is from investments only.</p>\n<p>The tax differential between earnings and investment income may be tempered somewhat, if corporate taxes reduce investment returns. Economists disagree about who actually bears the <a href=\"/posts/external/242/\">burden of the corporate income tax</a> but some of it likely falls on investors and thus boosts their effective tax rate. Of course, if some falls on workers, it also raises the effective tax rate on their earnings.</p>\n<p>Overall, Buffett\u2019s story is correct, but he did get a couple of things wrong.</p>\n<p>First, the 41 percent top tax rate he ascribed to his fellow workers appears to be a marginal rather than an average rate. That is, it\u2019s the tax on an additional dollar of income rather than total tax measured as a percentage of total income. A single worker\u2019s earnings must approach $500,000 before his combined income and payroll tax hits even 35 percent and the effective tax rate never tops 38 percent. For a married couple, total earnings have to near $1 million to hit those levels. Those are still very high rates, well above Buffett\u2019s 17.4 percent, but they\u2019re not as high as he asserted.</p>\n<p>More importantly, because of progressive tax brackets and the many exclusions, exemptions, deductions, and tax credits, <a href=\"/posts/external/243/\">typical taxpayers actually pay effective tax rates</a> well below the levels Buffett cites. And high-income taxpayers usually pay a higher effective rate than he does. The average household in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution (income between about $34,000 and $65,000) will pay combined income and payroll taxes equal to 12.0 percent of total income this year, compared with 19.6 percent for those in the top 20 percent (income over about $104,000) and 20.2 percent for those in the top 1 percent (income over roughly $533,000).</p>\n<p>Warren Buffett may be right when he says that high-income taxpayers could pay more, especially given the extremely rapid rate of <a href=\"/posts/external/244/\">income growth at the top of the distribution</a>. And he\u2019s certainly correct when he says that the low tax rate on investment income cuts his tax bill well below that of many Americans. But he\u2019s off base when he suggests that all high-income taxpayers pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than their middle-income coworkers.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/245/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1281, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Federal Debt Drama and What It Means for State and Local Governments", "text": "<p><em>Below is </em><em>a post I did for <a href=\"/posts/external/246/\">Metrotrends </a>on Friday.</em></p>\n<p>Financial markets have been on a pretty turbulent roller-coaster following the last minute bargain Congress struck to forestall a debt crisis, S&amp;P\u2019s downgrade of US Treasuries, and economic uncertainty in Europe. Most discussion has focused on national issues but it\u2019s important to ask what this all means for state and local governments. State and local budgets are <a href=\"/posts/external/247/\">still pretty tight</a>, with revenues well below 2008 levels (adjusted for inflation). But the current federal drama doesn\u2019t seem to be compounding subnational government woes.</p>\n<p>Most state and local officials knew that they were unlikely to get more federal aid after the stimulus funds dried up, but the actual deal struck by Congress is better than many states expected.\u00a0 The agreement cuts federal discretionary spending a lot but largely protects entitlements, including Medicaid (and Social Security and Medicare). New limits take the form of spending caps on discretionary spending using the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s \u201ccurrent law baseline,\u201d which adjusts for inflation. Baselines are often <a href=\"/posts/external/248/\">political creations</a> but they sometimes matter a lot\u2014Standard and Poor\u2019s really blew it by <a href=\"/posts/external/249/\">assuming the wrong one</a>\u2014and that\u2019s clearly the case for the cuts in discretionary spending.</p>\n<p>The money that state and local governments get from the feds is part of \u201cother domestic discretionary programs.\u201d Working off of an inflation-adjusted baseline means these cuts start from a higher level and thus aren\u2019t as bad as they could be. (In the short term\u2014i.e., fiscal 2012\u2014the caps on discretionary spending will slice about $2 billion from non-security programs). The debt agreement may not really solve the federal debt problem but, thanks to the magic of baselines, it doesn\u2019t do much short-term damage to state and local programs.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"/posts/external/250/\">Stateline</a> pointed out, the caps actually allow for $24 billion <strong>more</strong> in spending than the budget resolution the U.S. House of Representatives approved earlier this year. That bill, which died in the Senate, proposed cutting some state grant programs by as much as 20%.\u00a0</p>\n<p>State and local government aren\u2019t off the hook yet. \u00a0No one yet knows how Congress will allocate these cuts across domestic programs.\u00a0 The\u00a0 Super Committee has broad flexibility to cut both discretionary and entitlement programs\u2014and even raise taxes. But the chances of the panel reaching consensus are very small. If Congress can\u2019t agree on $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts by the end of this year, the debt limit deal requires automatic spending reductions starting in 2012. But these exempt most of the mandatory spending that makes up the social safety net, including Medicaid, CHIP (children\u2019s health program), TANF (welfare) and SNAP (food stamps).\u00a0 A few programs that affect state and local governments, such as education funding, early childhood assistance and affordable housing\u00a0 aren\u2019t protected. But in the short term at least, the debt agreement is unlikely to\u00a0 do much new damage to state and local budgets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So what about the Treasury downgrade?\u00a0 Despite getting the math wrong, S&amp;P stood by its downgrade and even said <a href=\"/posts/external/251/\">that other issuance downgrades would follow</a>. It has already cut its rating on some other government bonds, but those are largely housing development funds and bonds pre-funded by treasuries. S&amp;P seems to think that any investment backed by treasuries is more at risk. Meanwhile, the other ratings agencies have largely left things alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The markets seem to disagree with S&amp;P\u2019s assessment.\u00a0 In the wild ride of the past couple of weeks, Treasury yields have fallen to half century lows, and thanks to this rush to safety, many \u00a0<a href=\"/posts/external/252/\">muni yields have followed them down</a>. \u00a0Remember that many tax-exempts are still rated AAA. Thus, the rates that state and local governments must pay on new bonds are at all-time or multi-decade lows, saving issuers money. It might be odd that a subnational government can have a higher bond rating than its parent government.\u00a0 But when ratings are cut to reprimand Congress and the risk of default is still perceived to be close to zero, well, normal bond pricing rules might not apply.</p>\n<p>So what will affect state and local governments\u2019 bottom lines?\u00a0 The stock market tumble and economic conditions. While the current uncertainty might be good for muni-issuances, it has pushed down the return on state and local investments and will possibly cut their income tax revenues too.\u00a0 Specifically, public pension fund assets have lost value in the market fall, and state revenues look less rosy as capital gains turn to losses. And that will hurt states\u2019 financial ratings.\u00a0 Indeed, despite recent efforts by New Jersey to cut spending, <a href=\"/posts/external/253/\">Fitch just dropped the state\u2019s rating</a> from AA to AA- because of outstanding levels of debt and benefit obligations.</p>\n<p>Federal action can definitely affect how well or poorly subnational governments fare, but the current drama doesn\u2019t seem to have had much of a direct effect\u2014other than that caused by sending the economy and financial markets into a dizzying tailspin.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/254/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1282, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "More Budget Foxes, Fewer Hedgehogs", "text": "<p><em>My latest column at the <a href=\"/posts/external/255/\">Christian Science Monitor</a>:</em></p>\n<p>America&#8217;s fiscal challenges are often portrayed as a conflict between hawks and doves.

Both foxes and hedgehogs play important roles in the policy ecosystem in normal times. In times of great change, however, society needs more foxes and fewer hedgehogs. More citizens and leaders who can adapt to new conditions, and fewer who want to preserve the status quo.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where we find ourselves today. Despite all the anguish over a debt limit deal, America&#8217;s fiscal outlook remains daunting. Little progress has been made on our largest budget challenges. Despite bipartisan efforts, prospects for a grand fiscal bargain remain dim.</p>\n<p>One reason is that fiscal hedgehogs still have the upper paw on key issues.</p>\n<p>Consider entitlements. Everyone knows that entitlement spending is our No. 1 long-term budget challenge. Because of an aging population and rising health-care costs, spending on Social Security and federal health programs will explode. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over the next 25 years spending on these programs will rise from roughly 10 percent of the economy to almost 17 percent. Accommodating that growth would require substantial cuts in other government programs, much higher tax revenues, or unsustainable deficits and debt.</p>\n<p>The challenge is to find ways to keep the core benefits of these programs while reining in costs. This is where entitlement hedgehogs and foxes part company.</p>\n<p>The hedgehogs know one big thing: These programs provide major benefits. Social Security, for example, has dramatically reduced poverty among seniors and provides essential income to millions of retirees.</p>\n<p>Inspired by that one big thing, hedgehogs oppose any benefit reductions, such as increasing the eligibility age or trimming benefits to reflect increased longevity.</p>\n<p>Entitlement foxes have a more nuanced view. They recognize, like the hedgehogs, the value of the guaranteed retirement income that Social Security provides. But they also know that the number of retirees receiving benefits is growing faster than the number of workers paying payroll taxes. They know that Americans are living longer but retiring earlier. They know, in short, that the future will be different from the past and that the program needs to evolve to remain sustainable. Foxes are thus open to ideas like raising the eligibility age or changing the benefit formula.</p>\n<p>A similar dichotomy exists with taxes. Revenue hedgehogs know one big thing: Taxes place a burden on taxpayers and the economy. Thus, they oppose all tax increases, even efforts to reduce the many tax breaks that complicate our tax code.</p>\n<p>Revenue foxes see things differently. They recognize the burden that taxes place on taxpayers and the economy. But they also know that tax increases are not all created equal. Higher tax rates, for example, are usually worse for the economy than cutting back on tax breaks. Indeed, cutting tax breaks sometimes frees taxpayers to make decisions based on real economic considerations rather than taxes, thus strengthening the economy. That&#8217;s why revenue foxes support eliminating many tax breaks.</p>\n<p>Fiscal hedgehogs will never embrace such changes. To make progress, we need more fiscal foxes.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/257/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1283, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "The Coming Payroll Tax Role Reversal", "text": "<p>In a couple of weeks, President Obama will ask Congress to extend this year\u2019s payroll tax cut.

What would they all do without their ever-flexible baselines?</p>\n<p>There are some serious policy issues, of course. For instance, do we want to continue to reduce what was supposed to be a dedicated revenue stream for Social Security? And, so far, we know very little about what households have done with the payroll tax reduction they got this year\u2014averaging about\u00a0$1,000-per-worker. How much of it did people\u00a0spend?

Democrats will bring the idea up in the Senate as often as they can, all the better to charge that GOP Senator so-and-so voted twelve times to raise taxes on hard-working American families (RTOHWAF) . Come campaign time, they might even recycle an old Club for Growth ad from last year. You know the one: ominous music, images of closed businesses, female voice-over asking why our senator voted to RTOHWAF.</p>\n<p>Democrats, of course, will be able to add their own\u00a0rhetorical flourish by linking the payroll tax cut to tax hikes on hedge fund managers and oil companies. Republicans, they will say, are interested only in protecting the rich, and not working families.</p>\n<p>The Republicans, of course, will\u00a0play their own version of the same game. They seemingly love all tax cuts, except those proposed by Obama. Does anyone seriously believe they\u2019d oppose the identical\u00a0payroll tax cut if it came from, say, Mitt Romney or Rick Perry?</p>\n<p>And, of course, nine months ago, they had no problem at all extending those temporary tax cuts for a couple of years (and <a href=\"/posts/external/259/\" target=\"_blank\">adding</a> more than $800 billion to the deficit). But now, says House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI), such cuts are \u201csugar-high economics.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is nothing new in all this, of course.\u00a0 Exactly the same thing happened with climate change, health reform, and a fistful of other issues in recent years. Remember when Democrats preferred regulatory solutions to air pollution and trashed the market-based fixes adopted in the early \u201890s by Republican President George H.W. Bush?

It suggests, in fact, a politician who has gradually toughened his anti-tax views over the years but remains willing to boost some levies.</p>\n<p>Back in 1987, when Perry was a young legislator (and a Democrat) he <a href=\"/posts/external/261/\" target=\"_blank\">voted for </a>a $5.7 billion tax hike proposed by GOP governor Bill Clements. Even after Perry succeeded George W. Bush as governor in late 2000, he was not averse to raising some taxes, often while cutting others. In 2001, for example, he signed bills that raised the sales tax on fireworks and even signed an air pollution tax on the purchase or rental of diesel equipment.</p>\n<p>In 2002, according to a nice summary of his tax record by Karen Setze of State Tax Notes (subscription only), while Perry\u2019s Democratic opponent pledged to never raise taxes, Perry refused to make such a promise.</p>\n<p>Perry\u2019s biggest revenue challenge came in 2004-2006. Texas had been funding its schools through local property taxes, an arrangement courts found problematic. In 2004, Perry <a href=\"/posts/external/262/\" target=\"_blank\">proposed</a> replacing some school property levies with a basket of other taxes, including sales taxes, a higher cigarette tax, and an increased payroll tax.</p>\n<p>Perry\u2019s plan died in the legislature in 2004 but in 2006, after the state Supreme Court determined the school funding system was unconstitutional, lawmakers did pass a major tax reform bill\u2014a measure praised and signed by Perry. This version reduced local property taxes but created a new gross receipts tax on business (called a margins tax), raised the cigarette tax, and even taxed patrons of topless bars. \u00a0Thanks to my Tax Policy Center colleague Yuri Shadunsky for helping review the Perry years.</p>\n<p>Conservatives blasted the 2006 deal as \u201cthe largest tax increase in state history.\u201d \u00a0While it remains unclear whether this new mix of taxes was a net revenue increase, many in Texas did pay higher taxes. \u00a0</p>\n<p>In recent years, Perry has taken a much harder line on revenues but not an absolute one. While in 2009 he signed Grover Norquist\u2019s anti-tax pledge (to \u201coppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes\u201d), he also increased taxes on smokeless tobacco by $105 million over two years.\u00a0In June, Perry vetoed a bill that would have required some Internet retailers to collect Texas sales taxes.</p>\n<p>While state taxes are generally regressive,\u00a0Texas\u00a0is among the worst&#8211; not surprising since it\u00a0has no personal income tax. In 2009, the labor-funded\u00a0Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy <a href=\"/posts/external/263/\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> that the lowest-earning \u00a020 percent of Texas households paid about 12.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes, while the top 1 percent paid only 3.3 percent, compared to the national average of 10.9 percent and 5.2 percent . \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind when reviewing Texas taxes. The first is that the state has an extremely weak governor, one of the least powerful in the nation. Thus, many of these tax changes can properly be laid at the feet of the legislature, although Perry did sign them into law.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that Texas has enjoyed the benefits of the run-up in oil prices in recent years (the price of a barrel of oil was just $25 when Perry first became governor). High energy prices may be bad for most state economies, but not for Texas, where the oil and gas business <a href=\"/posts/external/264/\" target=\"_blank\">produced</a> $13 billion in state revenues last year, more than 40 percent of total revenues.\u00a0 Texas also receives an outsized amount of money from the federal government and has embarked on major spending cuts. In this environment, Perry has been under much less pressure to raise taxes than other governors.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: While Perry is no fan of taxes, neither has he been\u00a0an absolute opponent of all tax increases all the time.</p>\n<p>TWO CORRECTIONS</p>\n<p>While Perry did veto the online sales tax bill in June, he did sign a revised version in late July. This measure requires online sellers such as Amazon \u00a0to collect state sales taxes, but only if they own more than 50 percent of an in-state physical facility.

A) The corporation\u2019s owners could get a smaller return on their investment if the tax reduces profits. B) All owners of capital could suffer if the tax induces a reallocation of investment toward less profitable but untaxed endeavors, thus reducing the after-tax return to all affected capital. C) Workers could receive less pay if the tax causes investment to move away from the firms that employ them, leaving them less productive than they would otherwise be. D) Consumers could pay more for the firm\u2019s products if reduced output pushes prices up. Most likely the answer is E) All of the above.</p>\n<p>So which group actually pays how much of the tax?</p>\n<p>Economic analyses reach different conclusions, largely depending on what they assume about how readily capital and workers can move among industries and across borders. Some of the tax almost certainly falls on investors, since they can push the tax onto others only by moving to less profitable but untaxed activities (which pay more net of taxes) or raising prices and selling less. The question is how much and how quickly factors adjust to the tax.</p>\n<p>If capital can shift readily from taxed to untaxed businesses\u2014but workers can\u2019t\u2014much of the tax would likely fall on those workers. That\u2019s more likely when capital moves across national borders, making it harder for workers to follow. In a <a href=\"/posts/external/266/\">2006 Congressional Budget Office analysis</a>, Bill Randolph found that international capital mobility could result in American workers bearing 70 percent of U.S. corporate taxes. Other studies have found even higher shares falling on workers. <a href=\"/posts/external/267/\">Kevin Hassett and Aparna Mathur</a>, for example, showed that wages could actually fall by more than the amount of the tax increase, suggesting that workers bear more than 100 percent of the burden.</p>\n<p>By contrast, a <a href=\"/posts/external/268/\">more recent CBO study</a> by Jennifer Gravelle reviewed four papers looking at corporate tax incidence. Applying reasonable estimates of how economic activity changes in response to market changes (what economists refer to as \u201celasticities\u201d), Gravelle found that the owners of capital likely bear well over half of the corporate tax, particularly in the short run when capital cannot move much. And she argues that the long run\u2014when mobility is greatest\u2014could be very long.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/posts/external/269/\">Tax Policy Center\u2019s model</a> assigns the full cost of the corporate tax to owners of capital, but that assumption is far from settled. Future work may lead to different conclusions.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what economists conclude about the burden of the corporate tax, however, Romney was right in his unspoken assertion: Corporations may write the check, but it\u2019s people who ultimately pay corporate taxes.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/270/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1286, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "How Congress Can Cap Tax Breaks", "text": "<p>Sooner or later, Congress will realize it needs new revenues to help balance the budget, and trimming <a href=\"/posts/external/271/\" target=\"_blank\">tax subsidies </a>is the way to get them. \u00a0But will it tackle individual preferences, such as the <a href=\"/posts/external/272/\" target=\"_blank\">mortgage interest deduction,</a> one at a time? Or, will it try to limit the political bloodshed and go after these tax breaks across-the board?</p>\n<p>The Tax Policy Center has looked at <a href=\"/posts/external/273/\" target=\"_blank\">three\u00a0ways </a>to limit the benefit of tax subsidies for high-income households. Each would raise billions in new revenues\u2014money that could be used to both reduce the deficit and cut tax rates. And each would be quite progressive. However, they\u2019d work very differently.</p>\n<p>The first is the Obama Administration\u2019s<a href=\"/posts/external/274/\" target=\"_blank\"> proposal </a>to cap the value of itemized deductions at 28 percent. The second, called the Effective Minimum Tax, would require high income households to pay a rate of at least 21 percent on their Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) plus municipal bond income. The third is a modified version of a <a href=\"/posts/external/275/\" target=\"_blank\">plan</a> offered by Marty Feldstein, Dan Feenberg, and Maya MacGuineas that would limit the value of deductions and credits to 2 percent of AGI. Let\u2019s take a look at each of them.</p>\n<p><strong>The Obama plan</strong> would raise about $165 billion over 10 years (I\u2019m comparing each plan to current policy&#8211;that is, the taxes people pay today). According to this proposal, those in the 33 percent and 35 percent brackets could take all the same itemized deductions they do now, but their value\u00a0would be capped at just 28 percent. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Obama would raise taxes on about 5.4 million housholds. About 95 percent of the new taxes would be paid by the highest-income 5 percent of households, although a handful of middle-class people would\u00a0 also get clipped. The average tax hike in 2013 would be about $2,800, and the top 0.1 percent would pay an average of about $54,000\u00a0more than they do today.</p>\n<p><strong>The Effective Minimum Tax</strong> (EMT) was developed by TPC\u2019s Jim Nunns. It would operate something like the alternative minimum tax but would be imposed on a broader tax base and affect only top-bracket taxpayers. They&#8217;d\u00a0figure their regular tax, calculate their EMT rate, and pay the higher of the two. This levy would raise about $170 billion over 10 years. \u00a0Only about\u00a0400,000 households&#8211;all in\u00a0the top 5 percent&#8211;would pay more tax.\u00a0And they&#8217;d owe\u00a0an\u00a0average of\u00a0$80,000 more. Those in the top 0.1 percent of income would pay much more than under the Obama plan\u2014an average tax increase of more than $400,000.</p>\n<p>This tax, like the others, assumes the existing Alternative Minimum Tax remains on the books. But in the real world, if the EMT is enacted, I suspect the AMT would be repealed. If so, the plan would either have to impose a higher EMT rate or hit more middle-income taxpayers to generate the same amount of money. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Limit Tax Breaks to 2 Percent of AGI.</strong> The third broad cap on tax breaks is based on a plan designed by Harvard economist Marty Feldstein, Dan Feenberg at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and Maya MacGuineas of the New America Foundation. While they would have capped the value of most tax preferences at 2 percent of AGI for all taxpayers, TPC targeted the cap only at high-income households so we could better compare it to the other two plans.</p>\n<p>Importantly, while Obama would target only deductions, this proposal taxes a much broader base.\u00a0The 2 percent limit would also apply to\u00a0the value of employer-sponsored health insurance, the child and dependent care tax credit, and general business tax credits.</p>\n<p>Even scaled back to include only high-income households, this plan would generate twice as much money as the other two\u2014more than $500 billion over 10 years. About 2.8 million housholds would pay more, and the average tax increase\u00a0would be about $16,000.\u00a0The top 0.1 percent would pay about $240,000 more.</p>\n<p>These are just three examples of how Congress could tackle the $1 trillion in tax expenditures without battling over each one individually. \u00a0In an ideal world, Congress would\u00a0address\u00a0each on their economic merits. But, this is Washington, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to eventually see an across-the-board plan surface. And it is likely to look like one of these.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/276/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1307, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Forthcoming book with articles (including mine) on taxation and the financial crisis", "text": "The Oxford University Press is publishing \"Taxation and the Financial Crisis,\" edited by Julian Alworth and Giampaolo Arachi.

The fundamental benchmark interest rates in modern financial markets are the so-called risk-free rates on government bonds. Removing this pillar of the system\u2014or creating a high degree of risk around U.S. Treasurys\u2014would disrupt many private contracts and all kinds of transactions. In addition, many people and firms hold their rainy day money in the form of U.S. Treasurys. The money-market funds that are perceived to be the safest, for example, are those that hold only U.S. government debt. If the U.S. government defaults, all of them will \"break the buck,\" meaning they will be unable to maintain the principal value of the money that has been placed with them.<br /><br />\"The result would be capital flight\u2014but to where? Many banks would have a similar problem: A collapse in U.S. Treasury prices (the counterpart of higher interest rates, as bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions) would destroy their balance sheets. There is no company in the United States that would be unaffected by a government default\u2014and no bank or other financial institution that could provide a secure haven for savings. There would be a massive run into cash, on an order not seen since the Great Depression, with long lines of people at ATMs and teller windows withdrawing as much as possible.<br /><br />\"Private credit, moreover, would disappear from the U.S. economic system, confronting the Federal Reserve with an unpleasant choice. Either it could step in and provide an enormous amount of credit directly to households and firms (much like Gosbank, the Soviet Union's central bank), or it could stand by idly while GDP fell 20 to 30 percent\u2014the magnitude of decline that we have seen in modern economies when credit suddenly dries up.<br /><br />\"With the private sector in free fall, consumption and investment would decline sharply. America's ability to export would also be undermined, because foreign markets would likely be affected, and because, in any case, if export firms cannot get credit, they most likely cannot produce....<br /><br />\"The Republicans are right about one thing: A default would cause government spending to contract in real terms. But which would fall more, government spending or the size of the private sector? The answer is almost certainly the private sector, given its dependence on credit to purchase inputs. How much could it fall? Take the contraction that followed the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008 and multiply it by 10.<br /><br />\"The government, on the other hand, has access to the Fed, and could therefore get its hands on cash to pay wages. With the debt ceiling unchanged, this would require some legal sleight of hand. But the alternative would clearly be a collapse of U.S. national security\u2014soldiers and border guards have to be paid, the transportation system must operate, and so on. Issuing money in this situation would almost certainly be inflationary, but the Fed might conclude otherwise, because the United States has never been in this situation before, credit is now imploding, and the desperate credit-expansion measures implemented in 2008 proved not to be as bad as the critics feared.<br /><br />\"So this is what a U.S. debt default would look like. The private sector would collapse. Unemployment would quickly surpass 20 percent. The government would shrink, but it would remain the employer of last resort.\"<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-6276885946850219322?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/327/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1287, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Congressional Waste: The FAA and Airlines Taxes", "text": "<p>Congressional infighting last month over union rules and subsidies for small airports caused a lapse in authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration as well as the airline ticket taxes that help fund it.

As if that waste wasn\u2019t enough, the chairs and ranking members of the two congressional tax writing committees last week <a href=\"/posts/external/278/\">asked IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman</a> to forgo collecting the ticket taxes retroactively and to delay resumption of the tax for three days \u201cto restart processes to collect the taxes.\u201d And, not surprisingly, <a href=\"/posts/external/279/\">a bill</a> introduced yesterday would pay FAA workers for the two weeks they were laid off.</p>\n<p>The extension tacitly allows retroactive collection of ticket taxes because the House passed it before the July 23 expiration and therefore didn\u2019t contemplate the subsequent hiatus. The request to Shulman argued that the IRS shouldn\u2019t waste its scarce resources collecting the lost revenue. It might be hard to go after air travelers who didn\u2019t pay the tax but the IRS could target those airlines that took advantage of the tax interruption to raise their fares\u2014often by the exact amount of the suspended tax. The airlines might need the revenue but so does the federal government. And there\u2019s certainly no excuse for delaying reimposition of the tax\u2014the airlines adjusted quickly to the suspension and need virtually no time to reinstate it.</p>\n<p>The workers are another story. Congress has traditionally paid federal workers for periods when the government has shut down during parliamentary squabbles. Not doing so penalizes workers who would otherwise go payless through no fault of their own. Of course, that ignores the plight of the 70,000 construction workers who also lost pay.</p>\n<p>Congress acted irresponsibly when it failed to extend the FAA authorization before its expiration. Given our dire fiscal situation, we can\u2019t afford that kind of waste.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: This year\u2019s interruption of ticket tax collections repeats much longer breaks more than a decade ago. The tax disappeared for nearly the first eight months of 1996 and again for about three months in 1997 before Congress reauthorized it each year. In neither case were taxes collected retroactively but they apparently resumed without delay after each reauthorization.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/280/", "publication_date": "2011-08-24 23:09:49", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1288, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "What Can Obama Do to Fix the Economy?", "text": "<p>With the U.S. economy spinning its wheels, demands are growing for President Obama to \u201cdo something.\u201d\u00a0 But considering the nature of the slump and the political dynamics in Washington, there may be very little he can do to get the economy out of the ditch.</p>\n<p>Obama doesn\u2019t make his life any easier when he makes speeches that include no important initiatives, as he did on Aug. 8. Note to president: If you are going to go on TV, you better have something to say.</p>\n<p>Instead, Obama announced one new program\u2014a tax credit for businesses that hire unemployed veterans. My Tax Policy Center colleague Bob Williams figures the plan would subsidize the hiring of 12,000 to 50,000 vets. Companies would happily take the credit for hiring somebody they would have hired anyway, or for hiring a vet instead of a non-vet. But, either way, the number of new jobs created by this initiative would be tiny.</p>\n<p>What could a more aggressive Obama do? Voices on the left, such as Paul Krugman, <a href=\"/posts/external/281/\" target=\"_blank\">argue</a> that the president should push for a major new stimulus package, including more public works spending. The right wants more tax cuts. Leaving aside the question of whether either could pass Congress (they couldn\u2019t), is either the right cure for what ails the economy?</p>\n<p>Growth in the U.S. has stalled for several reasons. Banks still are not lending to domestic borrowers. In part this is because they are stuck with billions of dollars in non-performing or troubled real estate loans and are terrified of taking on more bad credits. Big public companies are swimming in cash, but won\u2019t invest in either new equipment or new workers until they see new customers. And construction remains dead in the water, with more than 4 million existing homes still on the market and millions more close to foreclosure. \u00a0</p>\n<p>These factors have been with us for a couple of years. What is new is a toxic wave of uncertainty driven partially by the U.S. fiscal mess and more so by deep troubles in the Eurozone.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s the cure? It is hard to see how more tax cuts would do the trick. Small businesses need orders and access to credit, not tax breaks. And there is no reason to believe that having even more cash sitting around will encourage big businesses to invest.</p>\n<p>What about tax breaks for individuals? Obama wants to extend this year\u2019s payroll tax holiday. That may help keep consumer demand afloat. But since we don\u2019t know what households have been doing with the extra cash they got this year, it is hard to predict what will happen if the holiday is extended. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>What about a big new stimulus plan? There is a good argument to be made that the U.S. needs an infrastructure upgrade and that such projects would provide a real boost to the construction industry. \u00a0But we learned in 2009 and 2010 that there are just not enough \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects out there to provide any kind of immediate boost to the economy. These projects will take years to roll out.</p>\n<p>In 2009-2010, Obama made cash available to hard-pressed states in an attempt to keep state employment going. But\u00a0a wave of GOP governors is enthusiastically laying off state workers. A check from Obama won\u2019t change their minds.</p>\n<p>So what can government do? It can work with banks to finally get all those bad mortgages off their books. Until those loans are written off, the absence of lending will continue to be a dead weight around the economy\u2019s neck. The Obama administration has failed repeatedly to resolve this mess. But with banks again demanding more liquidity from the Fed, this may be a good time for a quid pro quo.</p>\n<p>Government can also help reduce uncertainty by addressing its fiscal issues in a responsible way. You knew I\u2019d say that.</p>\n<p>But today\u2019s biggest problem today may be the stability of Europe. And that crisis is far beyond the reach of the U.S. government.\u00a0 Bottom line: There are steps Obama can take, but they mostly have to do with the dirty work of bank regulation.

Fortunately, we may soon get some new information to help sort it out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0My Tax Policy Center colleagues have tried to <a href=\"/posts/external/1/\" target=\"_blank\">clarify</a> some of this confusion by distinguishing between \u201csmall businesses\u201d and pass-throughfirms that report income on the individual tax returns of their owners. These can be S corporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, or limited liability companies. Using currently available IRS data, we\u2019ve concluded there are about 20 million people who report business income on their 1040s. Very few\u2014only about 3 percent\u2014are in the top two tax brackets (and even some of them would avoid higher tax rates under Obama\u2019s budget).\u00a0We\u2019ve also concluded that this handful of firms accounts for nearly half of all business income reported on individual returns.</p>\n<p>Yet, there is an awful lot we don\u2019t know. For example, we don\u2019t know how many are real businesses and how many represent a bit of side income for people otherwise employed at regular jobs (imagine, for instance, a tax economist who picks up a few bucks reviewing smartphones on the Web). At the same time we don\u2019t know much at all about those hedge funds, law firms, and real estate partnerships that likely account for a large share of the total business income reported on individual returns.</p>\n<p>Some of those information gaps may soon get filled in, thanks to some new data being pulled together by the Treasury Department. I got an early glimpse at a National Tax Association presentation on Thursday by Matt Knittel from Treasury\u2019s Office of Tax Analysis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>In some respects, Treasury\u2019s new research, still very tentative, confirms what we thought. For instance, it verifies that only about 3 percent of the owners of these firms are in the top two brackets. At the same time, the new analysis suggests that those high-income pass-through firms may generate a smaller fraction of business income than we thought\u2014perhaps less than one-third instead of half. That suggests that raising taxes on those high-earners would not only hit a relatively few people, it would also do less damage to the economy than we thought.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the same time, the new research takes a closer look at small firms. The proposed new methodology excludes those who make less than $10,000 in business income and report less than $5,000 in deductions. It also tries to screen out people who really work for an employer but are treated as consultants. Viewed through this lens, there may be many fewer small businesses than the political debate suggests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The new research also found that wage income is much more important to these taxpayers than many analysts thought, representing more than 40 percent of the 1040 income of business owners. That is very different than the popular image of the local dry cleaner who spends 60 hours a week at his establishment. Imagine instead an IT guy who works a regular job but moonlights for private clients as well. Or a plumber who works for a contracting firm during the day and does his own jobs at night. Or, it could simply reflect the wages of a spouse who holds down a regular job.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this analysis is a work in progress.\u00a0 But\u00a0Knittel and his Treasury colleagues may be developing\u00a0some valuable new information about small businesses and help us better understand both how they are treated under today\u2019s tax law and how they\u2019d be affected by proposed changes. With luck, this important research will be finished before the tax reform debate gets serious.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link":

Benefits Equitable?\"<br /><br />I've submitted my written testimony, with which I am reasonably pleased, and I will post it here once the Committee has released it officially.<br /><br />The other witnesses are (1) Scott Hodge of the Tax Foundation, (2) Aviva Aron-Dine, who has DC tax policy think tank experience and is getting an economics PhD at MIT, and (3) Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this may conceivably shape up as a bit of a tag team event, with Aron-Dine and me on the Democrats' side and Hodge and Reynolds (neither of whom I have met) on the Republican side.  But I hope not.  There are things that we ought to be able to agree about, plus other things on which we ought to be able to agree on why & how we disagree.<br /><br />If my several friends who do tax policy at AEI were among the Republican witnesses, I know that we would have this type of positive exchange.  But how it turns out may depend on a combination of who people are and what sort of expectations they believe they face.  (As an academic who doesn't want to be in Washington other than very occasionally, I am relatively exempt from such pressures.)  And there are certainly some things in my  testimony (albeit not everything) with which a principled conservative economist should be simpatico.<br /><br />BTW, as <a href=\"/posts/external/70/\">this</a> shows, I have published at Cato, in their Regulation Magazine.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-4209084259918739581?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/189/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1224, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "The Standard & Poor's Treasury bond downgrade", "text": "While I see significant prospects of a U.S. fiscal disaster at some point, reflecting my pessimism that the U.S. political system can handle a predictable set of problems that everyone sees coming, I am unsurprised that the bond market, as the <a href=\"/posts/external/74/\">Business insider</a> blog put it, gave Standard & Poor's a \"gigantic middle finger\" by pushing Treasury bond prices <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">up</span> (and yields down) upon hearing of the S & P downgrade.<br /><br />There are lots of interesting theories regarding why the bond market would react at all.  E.g., the S & P downgrade would force Washington to get serious.  Or, it caused stock prices to drop (as indeed happened simultaneously) on the view that economic disruption would hurt earnings, and this caused a flight to, ahem, quality.<br /><br />But the big mystery is that anyone would react at all.  It's not as if S & P knows anything special about the bond market situation.  And even when they do arguably know something, it's not as if their reputation is (or should be) stellar these days.<br /><br />Presumably it's a Keynes beauty contest reaction of some kind - investors are reacting to how they think investors will expect investors to react.<br /><br />Of course, there's one surefire way for the federal government to prevent any future downgrades: pay S & P to rate the bonds.  Then wow the S & P analysts with models in which (a) default is ruled out because it has never happened and (b) inflation forecasts are based purely on post-1982 data, and it's AAA, all the way, until the very end.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-2071205279850268884?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/193/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1241, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Stuff to Keep", "text": "<div><p>We get inundated with documents and things in life.&nbsp;

Sickness and busy-ness have kept me away.&nbsp; Hopefully the current tax season won't conspire to keep me away so much.&nbsp; Happy Valentine's Day, by the way.</p>\n\n<p>I recently became aware of the work of a law professor in Alabama who, after attending classes at a&nbsp; seminary, made a critical examination of the basis for taxation in Alabama.&nbsp; Her results were published in a law review article, here:&nbsp; <a href=\"/posts/external/97/\">Susan Pace Hamill's law review article</a><br /><br />The article is titled &quot;AN ARGUMENT FOR TAX REFORM BASED ON JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ETHICS&quot;.&nbsp; It reviews the current structure of the Alabama tax regime and compares that to the principles that are espoused from the Judeo-Christian viewpoint.</p>\n\n<p>I don't intend to have a significant political (or religious) aspect to this website, but where one discusses law and taxes, it is fairly difficult to avoid politics completely.&nbsp; My main thought regarding political issues is that we must always keep in mind the fundamental principals by which we choose to organize ourselves.&nbsp; Often, this is summarized by reference to the Constitution, and usually that is my starting point.&nbsp; We are best served when we remember that the nation is strongest when it maintains strong connections to the concepts of fairness, equality, liberty, freedom, privacy and other similar broad objectives embodied in the United States Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>When we ask ourselves, on any given issue, &quot;are we choosing a path that maintains our connection to these fundamentals?&quot;, I believe that is how we as a diverse nation can guide ourselves into the future and include the entire population, not just me, or those like me, or those that will benefit me.&nbsp; Ethically, and I believe Constitutionally, I am bound by my citizenship to consider my neighbor in making decisions that affect each of us.&nbsp; My neighbor is of course similarly bound.</p>\n\n<p>Susan Hamill's law review raises important issues for us to consider when we analyze and discuss tax policy.&nbsp; It may not be an answer, or a solution easily implemented, but that is not the message I take away from it.&nbsp; I hear that we need to examine our underlying assumptions about our society and the principles by which we maintain fairness, equality, liberty, freedom, privacy and the other grand notions of the founding fathers.</p>\n</div>", "image": "", "source": "http://fredmischler.blogs.com/frederick_focke_mischler/atom.xml", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/204/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1268, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "The Day After", "text": "<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;

Unfortunately, they concluded that the U.S. is lagging well behind the rest of the world in corporate reform and, worse, the odds of any serious progress anytime soon are slim.</p>\n<p>The group spoke to the National Tax Association\u2019s annual conference here in Washington. Jeffrey Owens of the OECD, Jack Mintz of the University of Calgary, Barbara Angus of the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, and William Morris of General Electric came to the panel with quite different perspectives. Mintz has advised the Canadian government in its successful efforts to lower rates and eliminate tax preferences. Morris discussed the U.K.\u2019s ongoing\u2014and so far less successful\u2014attempts to do the same. Angus talked about where the U.S. stands, and Owens provided a broad multi-national view.</p>\n<p>As we await possible reform plans from both the Obama Administration and the House Ways &amp; Means Committee, this panel put some interesting ideas on the table. Among them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mintz argued that Canada did not lose a lot of revenue by lowering its very high corporate rate, and suggested the U.S. would not either. \u00a0He said companies can both easily shift profits to other jurisdictions and take advantage of tax preferences when faced with very high rates. As rates are cut, firms are less likely to manipulate income. His view is more than a little controversial. Among others, Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service has found that a significant cut in U.S. rates would lose substantial tax revenue.</li>\n<li>Canada succeeded in cutting rates and broadening its corporate tax base thanks to a strong political consensus that formed behind the issue. Corporate rate cutting had the support of liberal provincial governments as well as a conservative national government.\u00a0\u00a0We are far from such a consensus here.</li>\n<li>GE\u2019s Morris, whose firm is enormously successful at keeping its tax bill low, said that firms might not object to a proposal that would end their ability to defer paying domestic \u00a0tax on foreign income until those profits are returned to the U.S. \u00a0However, he suggested they\u2019d give up that benefit only if the corporate rate were low enough (he did not define \u201clow.\u201d). \u00a0</li>\n<li>Unlike smaller countries, the U.S. might be able to get away with high tax rates given the many other advantages firms have doing business here.

Today\u2019s (at the Aspen Institute) gave me a chance to pose a question in exchange for my muffin: \u00a0Should Washington await the results of the 2012 election before reaching a cosmic budget agreement?</p>\n<p>It will, of course. The odds that President Obama and Congress will\u00a0reach across\u00a0the gaping fiscal divide anytime soon are vanishingly small. But does it even make sense for lawmakers to agree to what would be a profound change in the relationship between government and the people without first having an election?</p>\n<p>Here is\u00a0why they should wait\u2026and\u00a0why they should not.</p>\n<p>Why we need an election:</p>\n<p><strong>Education</strong>: The public desperately needs to learn about the real consequences of big deficits and what it would take to\u00a0reduce them. Polls show that people overestimate the cost savings of cutting foreign aid and \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d They also overestimate the financial problems of Social Security and grossly misunderstand the nature of Medicare. And they are completely mystified about the workings of the tax law. What better forum to highlight all of these issues than a political campaign? \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Consensus building</strong>: Today, the public is not prepared to either sacrifice benefits or pay higher taxes to reduce the deficit. A December 2010 <a href=\"/posts/external/2/\" target=\"_blank\">Pew poll </a>reported that only two deficit reduction ideas\u2014freezing salaries for federal workers and raising Social Security taxes for high-earners&#8211; enjoyed majority support. \u00a0Do Americans really want to cut the deficit, and how? That\u2019s what elections should be about. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The 1994 presidential race\u00a0is an interesting case study. Before that campaign, there was little public support for budget cutting. But key swing voters were moved by Ross Perot\u2019s ceaseless focus on the deficit, <a href=\"/posts/external/3/\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to political scientist James Shoch. Exit polls that year showed that more than half of all voters\u2014and two-thirds of Perot voters&#8211;saw deficit reduction as the single most important issue. While Bill Clinton didn\u2019t campaign on deficits (in fact, he ran on new public investment) he quickly flipped after the election\u2014in part because of that change in public mood generated by\u00a0Perot.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is why we should not wait for the election to address deficit reduction:</p>\n<p><strong>Promises. Promises</strong>. Candidates have an unfortunate tendency to make promises in political campaigns. And those vows make it harder, not easier, to reach the kind of political compromise necessary to reduce the deficit. A GOP candidate inevitably will be forced to take \u201cthe pledge\u201d to never, ever raise taxes. President Obama will be pushed by the left to \u201cprotect\u201d Social Security and Medicare. And reversing those promises can be fatal. The story of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s \u201cread my lips\u201d vow to not raise taxes and his subsequent abandonment of that pledge and election defeat is built into the DNA of all pols. Thus, there is no worse forum to highlight tough issues than a political campaign. \u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>The Noise. </strong>In theory, it sounds great<strong>: </strong>Obama lays out his vision of gvernment in an era of fiscal constraint. The GOP challenger does the same. An informed electorate chooses.\u00a0Flags waive. Birds sing. We all hum America the Beautiful.</p>\n<p>But what idiot thinks there will be a serious discussion of fiscal policy\u2014or anything else\u2014in 2012? Modern elections are decided on personality and unpredictable and ultimately irrelevant issues (Did Hillary cry? What about Rev. Wright?) Serious policy debates, such as they are, usually focus on topics that have little to do with the reality of governing. \u00a0For example, Obama\u2019s promise to close the prison at Guantanamo was far more important to many Democrats than his (rather modest) health reform plan. A real debate about <a href=\"/posts/external/4/\" target=\"_blank\">tax expenditures</a>? Please.</p>\n<p>Serious deficit reduction will await the 2012 election results.

Prices continue to fall, many would-be buyers can\u2019t qualify for mortgages, sales remain sluggish, and the backlog of potential foreclosures continues to grow. The benefits of the temporary tax credits offered in 2009 and 2010 have long since worn off. Meanwhile Congress is working to revamp Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while the FHA gets tougher and tougher on new borrowers.</p>\n<p>Housing clearly needs another boost and I have just the ticket.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s use Fannie and Freddie to deliver direct cash payments to buyers when they first take out mortgages and then send them checks each year until they pay off their loans. To boost demand as much as possible, let\u2019s give the most money to rich people who buy the biggest houses. </p>\n<p>After all, because jumbo mortgages have higher interest rates, giving bigger subsidies to people who buy the biggest houses in the most expensive markets makes sense. To really encourage people to borrow the most they can, let\u2019s pay 35 percent of the mortgage interest for the highest-income homebuyers but only, say, 10 or 15 percent for moderate-income people who borrow less.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you happen to live in a place that has cheap housing and low property taxes, you won\u2019t need any subsidy so we won\u2019t give you one.</p>\n<p>It may sound kind of crazy, maybe even totally misguided, but it just might work. </p>\n<p>Oh, wait a minute\u2014we already have a subsidy like that: the good old mortgage interest deduction. If you have enough deductible expenses to itemize, the federal government effectively pays part of your mortgage. And the bigger your loan and the more you earn, the more interest the government pays. Take a hedge fund manager making $1 million a year and paying $50,000 in annual interest.  The government pays 35 percent of that interest, a very nice $17,500. Meanwhile, a married couple holding down retail-sector jobs that pay a combined $60,000 gets just 15 percent of their $12,000 interest paid\u2014$1,800. <a href=\"/posts/external/24/\">TPC projects</a> that in 2015, more than 60 percent of the deduction\u2019s benefits will go to those in the top 20 percent of the income distribution and more than a third of that to those in the top 5 percent.

Who would design a program that subsidizes consumption of the wealthy many times more than everyone else? Why should the government pay you more for buying a bigger house? And even if there are good reasons to encourage homeownership (a debatable proposition), there\u2019s little evidence that our current tax subsidies have increased the percentage of people who own homes.</p>\n<p>As Congress looks for ways to close the nation\u2019s budget deficit, it makes a lot of sense to focus on ridding the tax code of its many subsidies, as both the president\u2019s fiscal commission and the Bipartisan Policy Center suggested last year. Tax expenditures reduce federal revenues by more than $1 trillion every year, sometimes sensibly but sometimes in ways that defy common sense, as in the case of the mortgage interest deduction. Slim down or get rid of the bad ones and we could lower tax rates and still raise more revenue.</p>\n<p>As for the mortgage interest deduction, scrapping it overnight could seriously damage the already weak housing market. Current homeowners already near mortgage default could tip over the edge. Homeownership costs net of taxes would jump, putting the opportunity out of reach for many Americans. But Congress could phase the deduction down or replace it with a more equitably distributed tax credit and thus improve the tax code over time without doing great damage to the housing market. (TPC has estimated the <a href=\"/posts/external/26/\">distributional effects</a> of a range of alternatives.)</p>\n<p>When you describe the mortgage deduction as the spending program it is, it sounds really foolish.

He wasn\u2019t talking about taxes (the laws were very different back in 1926) but his assertion certainly applies to the way the wealthy fare under today\u2019s tax law. </p>\n<p>For proof, take a look at the <a href=\"/posts/external/27/\">annual IRS accounting </a>of the income and taxes of the 400 taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross income (AGI). The latest report added 2008 to data for the previous 16 years. </p>\n<p>One way the super-rich are different: Their effective income tax rates have plummeted since they peaked in 1995. In contrast, effective rates for the rest of us have barely changed. Here\u2019s the story.</p>\n<p>To make the Fortunate 400 list in 2008, your AGI had to approach $110 million. Average income for the group topped $270 million. That\u2019s more than 4,700 times the $58,000 average for all tax filers. And the rich paid a lot of income tax\u2014just shy of $49 million on average, more than 6,750 times the $7,200 average for the rest of us. </p>\n<p>The very rich not only made lots more money, they made it in a very different way. Nearly 60 percent of their 2008 AGI came in the form of capital gains, almost all of it taxed at 15 percent. These \u00fcber-rich earned just 8 percent of their AGI in salary and wages. The rest of us? We got just 5 percent of our income from gains but 72 percent in salaries and wages. </p>\n<p>But the Great Recession hit the rich\u2014hard. Their AGI plunged by nearly a quarter between 2007 and 2008, compared to a 5 percent fall for everyone else (see first graph). And the drop was almost all in those tax-preferred capital gains: their gains fell nearly a third\u2014$29.2 billion\u2014almost exactly matching their drop in AGI. The rest of us also saw our investment income fall between the two years, but since gains are such a small share of our income, the drop didn\u2019t affect our AGI as much.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/external/28/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1415\" height=\"300\" src=\"/posts/external/28/\" title=\"TaxVox-Bob-May-12-2\" width=\"490\" /></a><br />\nTheir income collapse could not have made these folks very happy but their tax situation was worse. Not only did their AGI go into free fall, but their effective federal income tax rate actually rose from 16.6 percent in 2007 to 18.1 percent in 2008 (see second graph). That\u2019s not what you\u2019d expect when your income falls, but that\u2019s what happens when most of the drop came from tax-preferred gains. For the rest of us, the average effective tax rate fell from 12.8 percent to 12.4 percent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/external/29/\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1409\" height=\"300\" src=\"/posts/external/29/\" title=\"TaxVox-Bob-May-12-1\" width=\"493\" /></a></p>\n<p>Before you start feeling too sorry for the fortunate few, however, check out the sharp drop in their effective tax rate over the past 15 years\u2014down from 30 percent in 1995 to the 18 percent rate in 2008. Compare that with the 24 percent rate paid in 2008 by people with income between $500,000 and $1 million. The rest of us also saw our tax rate drop from a peak of 15.4 percent to 12.4 percent in 2008. But that doesn\u2019t take into account that AGI of the top 400 jumped 277 percent in real terms between 1992 and 2008, compared to a 77 percent increase for everyone else. Adding insult to injury, with so little earnings and so much investment income, the very rich pay a relative pittance in payroll taxes compared to the rest of us.</p>\n<p>Now for the caveats. First, AGI doesn\u2019t include all income. Exclusion of income from specific sources like municipal bond interest means that the IRS statistics don\u2019t necessarily include the richest 400. And the income included in AGI has changed as well, so comparisons across years may be a bit misleading. What\u2019s more, the Top 400 continually changes. Only four taxpayers appeared in every one of the 17 years the IRS examined. Nearly three-fourths of those who ever made the list showed up just once. That suggests that rare events\u2014selling a business or closing a one-off killer deal\u2014is enough to get you on the list. Once. On average, the very rich were rich enough not quite twice.</p>\n<p>Still even a one-time appearance puts you in pretty good shape. The average taxpayer would have to work well into the 68th century to earn as much as the average \u201c400\u201d member made in 2008 alone. With some careful financial planning and conservative investments, even the one-timers will probably outlive their nest eggs. </p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/171/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1209, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "California\u2019s Revenue Roller Coaster", "text": "<p>Last week, while admiring the seals frolicking on a San Diego beach, I read <a href=\"/posts/external/30/\">some good news</a> about California\u2019s tax collections. State officials had just announced that Fiscal Year 2010-2011 revenues will likely exceed expectations by <a href=\"/posts/external/31/\">$2 billion</a>, largely because personal income tax receipts are running ahead of projections.\u00a0 Though still below 2010 levels, April withholding exceeded estimates by $250 million and 2010 tax return payments were up $400 million. This good news followed <a href=\"/posts/external/32/\">earlier worries</a> that higher-than-expected refunds in February would continue throughout the filing season and wipe out earlier projected revenue gains. What should we make of those conflicting trends? And why is it so important for California to have a <a href=\"/posts/external/33/\">day-by-day report</a> on its April income tax revenues?</p>\n<p>My sense is the news is better but still not great. And, paradoxically, these few short-term positives could hurt the state\u2019s fiscal situation in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>California personal income tax revenues are a big deal because the state relies so heavily on the tax, which is highly sensitive to business cycles due in part to its progressive rate structure.\u00a0 In 2009-2010, personal income taxes accounted for 53 percent of general fund revenue. Fully a sixth of those receipts showed up in April. Revenues rose sharply as the state\u2019s economy boomed and then collapsed in the Great Recession. And the state\u2019s budget never really recovered from the Internet bust a decade ago. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>What accounts for the conflicting news about the state\u2019s income tax revenues? Those February refunds were probably the downside of a budget gimmick California used to help balance its 2009-2010budget. In passing it\u2019s budget the state increased income tax withholding but didn\u2019t actually raise tax rates. As a result, Californians effectively gave the state a one-year interest-free loan that was repaid in the form of refunds during the recent tax season.\u00a0 People who expected higher refunds probably filed early, while those who figured they still owed tax waited until April to file.</p>\n<p>The higher income tax receipts may also be the result of questionable federal tax policy that let individuals convert \u00a0<a href=\"/posts/external/34/\">regular IRAs to Roth IRAs in 2010</a> . True, taxpayers could have postponed paying the taxes associated with these conversions until 2011 and 2012. But many\u2014myself included\u2014opted to pay now to avoid potentially higher future federal taxes.\u00a0 Depending on how many did that, those higher short-run tax revenues may result in lower collections down the road when retirees withdraw Roth funds tax-free.</p>\n<p>None of this totally discounts this week\u2019s good news. The increase in April income tax receipts probably reflects both an improved economy and some one-time revenues from IRA conversions.\u00a0 But the outlook isn\u2019t totally rosy: indeed corporate tax revenues are down for the year.</p>\n<p>However, even with the new-found $2-$3 billion in revenues, California still faces expected annual budget shortfalls of $10 billion or more for the next four or five years. The state still has to make major structural changes in both revenues and spending.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this year\u2019s higher revenues might make it politically more difficult for Governor Jerry Brown to convince newly-complacent voters to approve an initiative extending temporary taxes for another five years.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Last month <a href=\"/posts/external/35/\">the Economist</a> wondered if reform was ever possible, given California\u2019s reliance on direct democracy and its seemingly endless voter initiatives.

They\u2019d \u00a0be exempt from\u00a0<a href=\"/posts/external/49/\" target=\"_blank\">spending limits </a>but still add billions of dollars\u00a0to the deficit. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Here is the story: The House Republicans want to<a href=\"/posts/external/50/\" target=\"_blank\"> convert </a>Medicare from an entitlement program into a direct government subsidy\u2014sometimes described as a voucher or, in polite society, \u201cpremium support.\u201d \u00a0Either way, instead of directly paying for the health care of seniors as it does today, Washington would cut a check for everyone 67 or older (the new age of eligibility in the GOP plan). Seniors would use the money to buy insurance on the private market.</p>\n<p>So what does all this have to do with spending caps? It is simple. If the Department of Health &amp; Human Services cuts the checks, these vouchers would be considered spending and thus subject to a spending cap such as the one <a href=\"/posts/external/51/\" target=\"_blank\">proposed</a> by senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Bob Corker (R-TN).</p>\n<p>But government doesn\u2019t have to spend money directly to fund senior health care. Instead, could subsidize health insurance another way\u2014through refundable tax credits.\u00a0 And if that happens\u2014if, in effect, the IRS writes the checks instead of HHS\u2014a big chunk of the subsidy would morph into a tax cut. And, lo and behold, hundreds of billions of dollars in federal subsidies would be exempt from a spending cap.</p>\n<p>Yet, the deficit would be exactly the same whether Congress chose to provide that assistance through direct spending or through a refundable credit. A subsidy of, say, $300 billion, would add $300 billion to the deficit no matter where it lived on the fiscal ledger. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Under current budget conventions, the refundable portion (that is, the piece of the credit that goes to recipients who already pay no tax) is considered spending. \u00a0But there is no way to know today how much of the credit would be refundable, or even whether budget process reform would change those rules. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>We do know that the consequences of running a voucher program through the tax code could be enormous.\u00a0McCaskill and Corker would cap spending at\u00a020.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2023. Medicare spending alone would exceed one-third of that, or more than 7 percent of GDP. Thus, shifting even part of Medicare from the spending side of the budget to the tax side would be a very big deal for fiscal politics even though it would not matter one bit when it comes to actual deficits. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Such a step would have all sorts of very weird consequences, however. For example, while many conservatives express outrage at the number of households who pay no income tax, subsidizing seniors\u2019 health insurance premiums through the tax code would\u00a0drive more people off the tax rolls. At a time when politicians are, rhetorically at least, dialing up their criticism of tax expenditures, operating vouchers as refundable credits would create a massive new one. Most perverse of all, to the degree these vouchers are treated as tax cuts, they could even free up more spending dollars&#8211;even under an outlay cap. \u00a0This, of course, is why Democrats would likely insist on using a tax mechanism as their price for supporting such big Medicare changes.</p>\n<p>Would a Medicare subsidy program be run through the tax code? I have no idea, although it is worth noting that the U.S. has some history here. See, for instance, the exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums as well as many provisions of the 2010 health law.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I do know, however, that a refundable senior health care tax credit could well be the poster child for what is wrong with spending, as opposed to deficit, caps.</p>\n", "image": "", "source": "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/feed/", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/174/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1212, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Who Pays No Income Tax?

They did it by looking at what would happen if Congress repealed all tax expenditures in 2015 (something like one of the plans proposed by the chairs of President Obama\u2019s fiscal commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson). \u00a0These <a href=\"/posts/external/58/\" target=\"_blank\">tax breaks </a>include everything from earned income and child credits to deductions for mortgage interest and charitable gifts to exclusions for employer-sponsored health insurance and retirement savings. They also include preferential rates for capital gains and dividends. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>TPC figures these tax breaks are worth about $1,000 to a typical household earning about $21,000 or less (the bottom 20 percent), boosting their after-tax income by 9 percent. Middle income households earning between $40,000 and $70,000 get an average of about $4,000, increasing their after-tax incomes by about 8 percent. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The story is very different at the top of the economic food chain. Those tax breaks are worth an average of $275,000 to those in the top 1 percent (who make at least $668,000) and $1.5 million to those in the top 0.1 percent (who make more than $3 million). These preferences allow those folks at the very top to boost their after-tax incomes by more than 20 percent\u2014more than twice\u00a0the benefit of those at the bottom. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>To put it another way, the highest-income 20 percent enjoy almost two-thirds of the benefits of tax expenditures. More than one-quarter goes to the top 1 percent alone. The bottom 40 percent? \u00a0They get about 10 percent (chart). \u00a0For some, it may be enough to zero out their tax bill, but compared to those at the top, it isn\u2019t much of an increase in income.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that as President Obama and Congress scrub the federal budget, the debate over who benefits from tax expenditures is just one piece of the puzzle. It is, for instance, also worth figuring out who benefits from direct government spending.</p>\n<p>But if you are arguing about who cashes in on those tax breaks in the federal income tax code, don\u2019t just look at who pays tax and who doesn\u2019t.

At the last minute (i.e., tonight), I have grown verging on enthusiastic, at least given my overall state of near-burnout and fatigue, about this talk.<br /><br />When I was asked to give this talk, I had nothing more definite in mind than to reprise the main themes of my forthcoming Tax Notes paper, \"1986-Style Tax Reform: A Good Idea Whose Time Has Passed.\"  Forthcoming, I should add, this Monday, May 23.  I will post a link on this blog as soon as I can; I'm pretty sure this can be done with Tax Notes articles once they're out.<br /><br />The problems with the approaching talk were twofold (apart from simultaneous classroom preparation).  First, although few people have seen my new paper as yet and I haven't widely discussed it, it's been on my mind over the last few months and I've discussed bits and pieces or ideas from it on numerous occasions (e.g., at my Senate Finance testimony earlier this month).  Thus, to me it no longer feels quite as fresh as it might at this point.  Second, it's U.S.-centric, hence not ideal for a talk in Singapore, especially to people who aren't any more tax-focused than they are U.S.-focused.<br /><br />But I've been idly discussing Singapore-specific factors with various people during my brief stay here, and now feel qualified (at least for a fairly casual talk to a moderate-sized audience) to take things in a fresher and more locally pertinent direction.  Hence, my lunch talk is now entitled (in my own mind; I didn't get to tell the organizers in time for any signage to reflect it), \"Tax Reform: Singapore Versus the U.S.\"<br /><br />As I've mainly written it out, I'll consider posting the talk's main contents here if, after the session is done, I still feel good about it.

You can view a stream of the entire proceedings <a href=\"/posts/external/61/\">here</a>, and you can read my full written testimony <a href=\"/posts/external/62/\">here</a> or <a href=\"/posts/external/63/\">here</a> (the latter corrects an erroneous number from the testimony I actually submitted).  In addition, the shorter written remarks that I prepared for my 5-minute slot, and then delivered more or less verbatim (taking exactly 4:57!), are available <a href=\"/posts/external/64/\">here</a>.<br /><br />My remarks emphasized three main points:<br /><br />(1) Rising high-end income concentration may influence how one thinks about high-end tax rates, in particular as part of a broader tax reform process.  In the 1986 tax reform process, people thought about high-end distributional neutrality as purely a function of making before-and-after comparisons for two groups: those earning from $100,000 to $200,000, and those earning more than $200,000.  A much more nuanced approach to the high end may be necessary today (e.g., the Fiscal Commission Report looked at the top 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, and 0.1%).<br /><br />(2) The big-ticket tax expenditure items (such as home mortgage interest deductions, the employer-provided health insurance exclusion, and charitable deductions), tend to provide benefits that rise relative to income until close to the top of the income distribution, when they start falling as a percentage of income.  This makes it quite difficult to achieve distributional neutrality 1986-style at the very top unless one starts addressing items such as the 15% dividend rate, which (a) doesn\u2019t hit wage earners at the very top and (b) arguably isn\u2019t a tax expenditure given the double corporate taxation issue.<br /><br />(3) If tax expenditures are equivalent to spending through the tax code (as asserted by both the Fiscal Commission and the Ryan Budget plan, and as best illustrated by David Bradford\u2019s weapons supplier tax credit example), then repealing them is not in substance a \u201ctax cut,\u201d and hence doesn\u2019t need to be accompanied by tax rate cuts even if one has some view about tax revenues and the size of government.  The ONLY reason to cut individual income tax rates, especially in the face of the long-term fiscal gap, is if the equilibrium one prefers (and can get to) includes lower rates, a point on which I am quite skeptical.  More on this in my May 23 Tax Notes piece, \u201c1986-Style Tax Reform: A Good Idea Whose Time Has Passed.\u201d<br /><br />At the hearing, the Republicans had a coordinated theme decrying the fact that, according to a Joint Committee on Taxation estimate, in 2009 51% of all households paid zero in income taxes. 51 percent is ostensibly a \u201ctipping point\u201d (although in fact it reflected the temporary impact of the recession), and is said to be a concern because you have no \u201cskin in the game\u201d if you pay no income tax, and thus ostensibly will vote under the \u201cfiscal illusion\u201d that government spending is free.<br /><br />I would question how much political influence we should attribute to Americans who are too poor to pay income tax.  Political scientists such as Hacker and Pierson would presumably say, try zero as a good baseline estimate of their influence.  If I were looking at a fiscal illusion that government spending is somehow \u201cfree,\u201d I would start my analysis with deficit financing.  Plus, as I commented at one point, it is a mistake to focus on just one year and just one tax.<br /><br />One of the Republican Senators at the hearing dismissed the significance of payroll taxes in this regard by noting that they are associated with providing Social Security and Medicare benefits at retirement, rather than going into general revenues.  But more specifically, he called payroll taxes merely an \u201cinsurance premium.\u201d<br /><br />If payroll taxes are insurance premiums rather than taxes, and Social Security / Medicare benefits are insurance payouts rather than government spending, I suppose we will need to restate our budgetary accounts a bit.<br /><br />Another coordinated theme on the Republican side of the aisle was that it's simply wrong to have the income tax system do anything whatsoever to affect distribution.  It should simply be about raising revenue to pay for government outlays, period.  Anything else is immoral.  I replied that, if this is the case, we should definitely have a uniform head tax, under which Bill Gates would pay the same amount of tax as a homeless person.  And if this is wrong (and I noted that Margaret Thatcher, who had been lauded earlier in the hearing, ran into some problems with a head tax), and we indeed want to tax something such as income based on some such notion as ability to pay, then we are all really playing the same game, and there is nothing left to complain about at a philosophical level.<br /><br />I think it came out sounding a bit less harsh than that, but hopefully the point was clear.<br /><br />One of the Democratic Senators invited me to take some pretty open potshots at the degree of good faith in the tax part of the Ryan budget, but I declined to impugn motives, and simply said that I felt its rate cuts were unwise and that its base-broadening remained entirely unspecified.  But I granted that it's a lot easier to criticize popular but bad policies if you have my job than if you are a member of Congress.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-6442609785555281499?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/180/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1218, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Last 2011 NYU Tax Policy Colloquium", "text": "Last Thursday, Cheryl Block presented her work in progress, \u201c<a href=\"/posts/external/65/\">Tax Justice and the Equitable Distribution of Bailout Costs</a>,\u201d as our last paper of the semester.<br /><br />The paper posits that public anger over the financial sector bailout, along with reasons for thinking that the anger might in various respects have been justified, suggests the possibility that ability to pay principles don\u2019t provide the best guide to thinking about how the costs of the bailout would equitably be distributed.  E.g., is the view that the financial sector ought to pay a distinctive view that we need to think seriously about?<br /><br />Cheryl agrees that there may be important incentive reasons for making the people who caused (and may again cause) a bailout to be necessary pay for the expected costs of their behavior.  Not only ex ante, before they act, but even ex post, if the lesson that is learned will impress itself upon future actors.  But she wants to leave the efficiency analysis to one side, for purposes of considering the equity issues as well.<br /><br />My main criticism of this is that there is a considerable overlap between giving people proper incentives and deciding whether they are blameworthy or not.  Our intuitions (in the realm of \u201cdistributive desert\u201d) about punishing the guilty, etcetera, have a lot of overlap with the idea of giving people proper incentives (and not minding what they decide if they had the right incentives to consider harm to others, etc.).  So it is difficult to pursue this analysis independently of efficiency even if one concludes that one\u2019s (or at least my) admitted emotions of distributive desert (a.k.a. retribution) should be preferred to, say, utility maximization where the two, despite their considerable overlap, prove to be in conflict.<br /><br />Also, I would say that the financial sector as such can\u2019t pay since it\u2019s not a human being.  When we say this we presumably have particular individuals in mind \u2013 e.g., in this case, the managers and other highly-paid employees in the financial sector, along with their pals in the rating agencies, captured regulatory agencies, etc.<br /><br />Just because it\u2019s been a very busy semester, I was relieved to have it come to an end, even though so much of it is very interesting and fulfilling.

Pretty fast turnaround there, admittedly adding a bit to the stress, although I am hopeful that the Singapore class will go well too.<br /><br />Next year (January through April 2012), I\u2019ll be teaching the colloquium on Tuesdays with Alan Auerbach.

Sometimes referred to as 'tax expenditures,' these distortions are similar to government spending \u2013 instead of markets directing economic resources to their most efficient uses, the government directs resources to politically favored uses, creating a drag on growth.<br /><br />\"The key difference is that, with spending, the government collects the money first in the form of taxes from those who earned it, and reallocates the money elsewhere. With tax expenditures, government agrees not to collect the money as long as it is put to a government-approved use. Other tax expenditures literally do take the form of spending through the tax code, because they 'return' more money than the taxes owed.<br /><br />\"Tax expenditures have a huge impact on the federal budget, resulting in over $1 trillion in forgone revenue each year (although the exact definition of a 'tax expenditure' is subject to debate.) To put that number in perspective, $1 trillion is roughly the total amount the government collects each year in federal income taxes.<br /><br />\"Eliminating large tax expenditures would not be for the purpose of increasing total tax revenues. Instead, when offset by lower rates, it would have a doubly positive impact on the economy \u2013 it would stop diverting economic resources to less productive uses, while making possible the lower tax rates that provide greater incentives for economic growth.\"<br /><br />A cynic might note that the above analysis will earn no \"profiles in courage\" award.  No less than President Obama when praising 1986-style tax reform on the individual side, the Republicans assiduously avoid naming even a single provision - although the revenue numbers make unmistakable the intended reference to home mortgage interest deductions and the employer-provided health insurance exclusion.<br /><br />Also, the discussion formally adheres to the Norquist rule that tax revenues, as officially computed, can never rise, given the accompanying rate cuts.<br /><br />But it presents the base-broadening and rate cuts as two distinct sets of changes, each to be endorsed on its independent merits.  And it offers no indication that the \"key difference\" it cites between direct spending and tax expenditures has any policy relevance whatsoever.  It is therefore effectively a straight-out endorsement both of tax expenditure analysis as the right intellectual framework, and of tax expenditure repeal in the context of addressing the fiscal gap.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-7800643173295527548?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/45/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1237, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "The Ryan budget plan for Medicare and Medicaid", "text": "I've been mocking the idea that either party - but least of all the Republicans - has any real interest in slowing our march off the cliff of fiscal disaster.  But now comes the Ryan plan to cut Medicare and Medicaid, which one could argue has the potential to steer us away from the cliff.<br /><br />I only say \"one could argue\" that it has this potential, because the real question would be whether future Congresses were willing to deny funding for healthcare that voters were demanding.  Either under present law or the Ryan plan, Congress in 10 or 15 years will face the same choice between unsustainable spending growth on the one hand, and denying people valuable and important healthcare procedures on the other.<br /><br />I'm skeptical that the Ryan plan is going to go anywhere politically, at least over the next three years (i.e., spanning the 2012 election).  If the Democrats have any sense (irrespective of whether the plan is actually good or bad), they will fight hard against it.  It obviously can't be passed this year without their full cooperation, and cutting healthcare might be an unappealing Republican banner for the 2012 election.<br /><br />But then again, who knows?  I'm not convinced that either the Administration or leading Democrats in the Senate actually share their party's historic convictions.  They may also lack the guts to contest this in the terms that Karl Rove and Frank Luntz would urge if working for them.  Obama, I suspect, actually secretly agrees with the plan, as he has pretty broadly bought into the pro-free market ideological shift of the last 30 years - a shift that has had both good and bad policy consequences.  Thus, it is not just, as Krugman <a href=\"/posts/external/90/\">intimates</a>, that he is desperately eager to be \"nice\" (although that may play a role as well).<br /><br />Regimes fall when their proponents no longer believe in them.  I also suspect that the long-term U.S. political equilibrium is to gut Medicaid.  When the political preferences of poor Americans have essentially zero political weight, as <a href=\"/posts/external/91/\">this article </a> and the recent <a href=\"/posts/external/92/\">Hacker-Pierson book</a> suggest, there may be no reason to expect significant medical aid to the poor.  And if only the top 10 percent of the income distribution matter politically, as these sources also suggest, then why not cut everyone else's healthcare?  Maybe this is politically feasible after all, and even if one dislikes it as policy it might still in principle lead to averting fiscal disaster, albeit at a social cost in other ways.  But then again it may remain farfetched to think that Congress in ten to fifteen years will decline to pay for seniors' healthcare spending - even if it is willing to throw the poor off the Medicaid bus.<br /><br />OK, enough on politics and projections, what actually is the plan?  The most convenient source I've found is <a href=\"/posts/external/93/\">Uwe Reinhardt</a> in his NYT Economix Blog.  So what I'll do next is quote, in bold, his list of the plan's 6 key features, and then insert some commentary.<br /><br /><strong>\"1. The change would not affect people eligible for Medicare currently 55 or older, who would remain in the traditional program. The new rules would start in 2021 \u2014 that is, for persons currently under age 55.\"</strong>   Ouch.  I am a bit under 55; as it happens I have an older sibling who is just over.  Looks like one of us will do better in this regard than the other.  More particularly, this bright line is inequitable.  There's no reason why older individuals who have adequate financial resources should be exempted from sharing in the budgetary hit, and treated so much differently than younger ones with only slightly more time to plan.  But perhaps, as a consumer, I should take comfort from Matt Yglesias' <a href=\"/posts/external/94/\">observation</a> as follows: \"If a 'divide and conquer' strategy succeeds in abolishing Medicare for people born after 1956 ... [o]ver time you\u2019ll have a growing set of private voucher firms lobbying for more people to lose Medicare and be put into the voucher pool. You\u2019ll also have a declining set of people born before 1956 to object to Medicare abolition. And you\u2019ll have an ever-growing pool of people born after 1956 who\u2019ve been told that they\u2019ll never benefit from Medicare no matter what happens, but who are being asked to pay the taxes that finance it.  That doesn\u2019t strike me as a remotely sustainable equilibrium.\"<br /><br /><strong>\"2. Beneficiaries who turn 65 in 2021 or later would receive from Medicare a voucher to purchase private health insurance.\"</strong>  Ryan wants to deny it's a voucher, but his argument appears to be purely formalistic, based on sending funds directly to the insurance companies, rather than via the consumers.  When you get to the rate of voucher growth over time (see below), this is the big source of budgetary saving.  But it is independent of the fact that one is using vouchers rather than the current system.  Vouchers that grow fast enough don't save any money, whereas the current system with tighter spending and reimbursement controls can save all the money one likes (albeit with the same painful tradeoff of people being denied care, e.g., as healthcare provides opt out of Medicare).  Now, there would be big cost savings if healthcare \"privatization,\" which is what's going on here, were itself a source of efficiency gain.  But healthcare experts are skeptical of this, reflecting that it's a market in which consumer choice doesn't work very well.  Jonathan Gruber, for example, referring to recent Medicare experiments with HMO-style \"Medicare + Choice,\" <a href=\"/posts/external/95/\">says</a>: \"Our existing efforts to privatize Medicare have failed ... We don't have a good track record ... the [potential Ryan plan] savings doesn't come from all the good things from competition -- it comes from cutting Medicare over time.\"<br /><br /><strong>\"3. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 'the amount of the voucher would be calculated by taking the average federal cost per Medicare enrollee in 2012 (net of enrollee premiums) and growing that amount at the annual rate of growth in G.D.P. per capita plus one percentage point.'\"</strong>  This is the million-dollar question for which no one has a good answer.  Healthcare expenditures are growing relative to GDP.  They probably should. due to the incredible things that tecnnology increasingly makes possible - saving and extending lives, and greatly increasing suffering people's quality of life.  But what is the limit given that it can't consume anywhere near 100% of GDP?  This is a bit of a conundrum given that our usual model for making good allocative decisions - well-informed consumer choice - is problematic in the healthcare sector.  This very likely does mean, however, that - if Congress stuck to it - increasingly people who are not rich would be denied healthcare treatment that would have enormously helped them, in life-saving and life-changing ways.  BTW, Ryan has a point here, which should be acknowledged, when he insists (correctly) that merely the growth rate is being cut.  If the plan were to take force, non-rich people in twenty years might in <em>absolute</em> terms still get better care than anyone is getting today - but they might be getting far worse care <em>relative to what was contemporaneously available</em>.<br /><br /><strong>\"4. The voucher amount would be adjusted by the beneficiary\u2019s geographic location and health status and would be means-tested \u2014 that is, it would be higher for lower-income beneficiaries than for those with higher incomes.\"</strong>  Obviously, the details are important here distributionally.  The tax law and econ literature (see, e.g., pieces by Louis Kaplow and by Tom Griffith/Michael Knoll) is a bit skeptical of regional cost of living adjustments, which create moral hazard (I get the taxpayers to pay more by living in a high-cost area that may offer consumer amenities or, in the case of healthcare, higher regional treatment norms).<br /><br /><strong>\"5. Starting in 2013, beneficiaries would face a $600 combined deductible for ... [the two main parts of] Medicare combined, but pay a 20 percent co-insurance on each part \u2014 including hospital care \u2014 up to a catastrophic out-of-pocket limit of $6,000, after which cost-sharing would be zero.\"</strong>  [OOPS - previous analysis here deleted, as a commentator suggests I misinterpreted this.]<br /><br /><strong>\"6. Between 2021 and 2032, the eligibility age for Medicare would be increased to 67, from 65.\"</strong>  I might be fine with this if Medicaid were sufficiently strong, but obviously it won't be under the plan.<br /><br />The fundamental question remains, what should the long-term healthcare system look like?  In many areas I have strong pro-market sympathies, although I also want the government to address externalities and distributional issues (both of which can readily be seen in terms of market failure).  But one has to have good sense about where markets don't work so well.  I believe healthcare is one of the paradigmatic such areas, which is one reason why countries with single-payer healthcare systems often get better results than the U.S. in healthcare outcomes per dollar spent.  The financial sector is another such area, as even Alan Greenspan briefly recognized (before reverting to his ignorant-idealogue type).  How best to structure the healthcare portion of the economy is the real question in policy design, but I don't expect a reasoned political debate about this.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-2663545457837631310?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/184/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1233, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Shaggy dog story decoded", "text": "I recently gave a few listens to the unreleased \"New York Sessions\" version of Dylan's well-known 1975 album, Blood on the Tracks.

But in a sense # 2 is a version of # 1, since one would likely be more careful to avoid serious and transparent errors if, say, one's own life were at stake.<br /><br />It's certainly evidence in favor of those who say he's an ignoramus and a fraud.<br /><br />But that said, let me quasi-almost-but-not-quite defend his Medicare proposal.<br /><br />First, let's stipulate up front that the structural change he proposes for Medicare (which prominent Republicans have admitted, though not for attribution, is essentially repeal of the existing program) has actually no direct link to the long-term funding question.  It's a separate structural change.<br /><br />To explain, let's back up for a moment and recall President Bush's personal accounts proposal for Social Security in 2005.  (I'm being nice here in using the term instead of \"privatization,\" which is what the proponents called it as late as December 2004.)  The Bush Administration admitted, with surprising honesty, that the proposal would do nothing whatsoever to address Social Security's funding shortfall.  Instead, it used the funding shortfall as a convenient occasion for both (a) addressing the funding issue through changes that could essentially have been done through the existing program, and separately (b) changing the relationship within the program between taxes (or contributions, or whatever you want to call them) and benefits.<br /><br />As I've <a href=\"/posts/external/87/\">written</a>, I tend to dislike the way the existing Social Security program more or less deliberately obscures the relationship between what you pay and what you get.  Some proponents like this deliberate obscurity as a political device for achieving greater progressivity within the program than one might otherwise have expected.  But it also obscures big transfers within the system that we might dislike (e.g., from younger to older age cohorts, and from singles and two-earner couples to one-earner couples).  And perhaps the confusing structure causes Social Security to discourage labor supply more than it would if the marginal tax-benefit relationship were better understood (and made more uniform).<br /><br />So I like clarifying the tax-benefit relationship, as the Bush proposal did, although I might have preferred keeping some progressive redistribution in the program (but made more overt).  I called this idea \"progressive privatization\" but it never caught on anywhere.<br /><br />I was less thrilled about the Bush plan's inducing people to bet more of the baseline piece of their life savings on the stock market instead of having a fixed real life annuity that sound portfolio choice dictates holding as one's bedrock.   But the ability to bet on the stock market was a distinct program feature from clearifying the tax-benefit relationship (privatization was an arbitrarily assembled package of distinct changes).<br /><br />But back to the main point that parallels Ryan's Medicare plan.  Whether one liked the set of proposed Bush changes or not, there was absolutely no true link between its merits and the long-term Social Security funding crisis (such as it is).  If good, it should have been adopted even in the absence of any funding crisis; if bad, the funding crisis offered no reason to adopt it.<br /><br />The same is true of Ryan's Medicare plan.  We could put the current Medicare system on a sustainable path by shrinking the rate of expenditure growth under it (e.g., via reimbursement rates, the approved treatments list, co-payments and premiums, etc.).  Or we can convert to Ryan's system, essentially vouchers for privately obtained health insurance, and achieve no budgetary improvement by letting the vouchers grow at the existing and expected rate of healthcare expenditure growth relative to GDP.<br /><br />Ryan's projected cost savings come from constraining the rate of voucher growth.  But suppose that actually doing this 10 years down the road is no less politically difficult than tightening the screws under the existing system.  Then you may get no cost saving.<br /><br />This strikes me as an extremely credible scenario.  Why should Congress be loyal to the Ryan plan in 2025, when seniors who vote in large numbers start screaming about the affordability of care they want on the vouchers they're getting?  (If we use quasi-constitutional budget rules that make this difficult, they could instead be combined with existing Medicare.)<br /><br />In sum, therefore, there really are two distinct questions.  One is how to put healthcare on a sustainable path (looking both at the federal budget and people's pocketbooks) given the growth scenario that we now face.  The other is how the system ought to be structured.<br /><br />If Ryan's design is better than existing Medicare, we should do it even in the absence of a long-term fiscal crisis.  But if it's worse, then we should keep the existing system and tighten the fiscal screws via that.<br /><br />All this does not rule out a political economy argument that adopting the Ryan plan makes tightening the screws easier to accomplish politically.  But that would be a very different argument from the ones that we're hearing, and I don't see how it could be made convincing.<br /><br />OK, what about arguments that Ryan's system would be economically much more efficient because it's more private market-driven?  That admittedly might affect the fiscal tradeoffs - although serious healthcare economists such as Jonathan Gruber appear to reject it - but really it's just a part of the debate over which system is better in the fiscally sustainable steady state.  After all, you'd want to be more efficient, all else equal, no matter what.<br /><br />The case against a Ryan-style Medicare change concerns claims of pervasive market failure in healthcare, reflecting not just the quirks of the U.S. system but broader structural issues (e.g., consumer ignorance about desperately important treatment choice issues; problems of adverse selection; problems of moral hazard once we decide that we are unwilling to deny care to desperately ill people who can't pay for it).<br /><br />The contrary position, that we should simply let markets work their magic in healthcare no less than in the market for fresh fruit or for shoes, is something that I disagree with but consider intellectually respectable.  So in that sense I am inclined to be tolerant of a proponent of the Ryan plan (including Ryan himself), as within the realm where we value and may all benefit from open intellectual debate.<br /><br />But the long-term fiscal gap appears to offer no particular support for Ryan's position.<br /><br />One last point: perhaps it's not all that \"brave\" after all to count on Congresses 10 years from now to tighten the screws on healthcare spending growth in a manner quite distinct from anything that he actually proposes to implement currently.  \"Brave\" would be advocating a large cut in healthcare spending TODAY, followed by a faster growth rate (to get to the same budgetary place long-term) given the stunning technological improvements that we have reason to hope will be available in the future.<br /><br />UPDATE: Daniel McCarthy at American Conservative Magazine <a href=\"/posts/external/88/\">agrees</a> with me that Ryan is not actually \"brave\" but loading all the pain off into the future so that other politicians would have to bear it.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-4167335925842033274?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/186/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1238, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Health Care Powers of Attorney", "text": "<div><p>Below is copied an old email message I sent out to some friends.&nbsp;

In the sale of a piece of property, the seller is the &quot;grantor&quot; and the buyer is the &quot;grantee&quot;.&nbsp; There are 6 statutory forms for deeds in Ohio.</p>\n\n<ul><li>General Warranty Deed</li>\n\n<li>Limited Warranty Deed</li>\n\n<li>Quit Claim Deed</li>\n\n<li>Survivorship Tenancy</li>\n\n<li>Transfer on Death Deed</li>\n\n<li>Executor or Trustee Deed</li></ul>\n\n<p>The General Warranty Deed is used when the grantor will provide to the buyer warrantee promises that the grantor lawfully owns the property to be transferred, that the property is free from <u>all encumbrances</u>; that the grantor has good right to sell and convey the property, and that the grantor does warrant and will defend these statements of ownership forever, against the lawful claims and demands of any person.</p>\n\n<p>So, a general warranty can be a pretty tall order.&nbsp; They are the most desireable deed to have since you should get the protection of prior owners if there are any questions raised about your ownership of property.&nbsp; This can mean that there has been some error or problem in the past which has caused some questions about who actually owns property.&nbsp; If such title errors come up, past owners who transferred property with a general warranty deed can be called upon to defend against people who make a claim of ownership on property.</p>\n\n<p>A <u>limited warranty</u> deed does the same thing, except the grantor only warrants against his or her own encumbrances, and not all encumbrances.&nbsp; A grantor transferring with a limited warranty deed only promises to defend against claims that challenge that grantor's prior ownership of property.&nbsp; A <u>quit claim deed transfers property with no promises</u> about the ownership of the property and no promises to defend against claims made on the ownership of the property.</p>\n\n<p>Survivorship tenancy relates to the usual joint and survivor type of ownership that a husband and wife might have.&nbsp; But, this is not a deed which only married couples can use.&nbsp; Any 2 or more people can own property jointly, with rights of survivorship.&nbsp; Thus, 2 sisters might own a house with a survivorship tenancy deed and when the first sister dies, the property is automatically (or rather, still) the property of the surviving sister.&nbsp; Similarly, 2 friends might jointly own property and if one dies, the other becomes the sole owner.&nbsp; And, this deed can be used by more than 2 people.&nbsp; A group of people might own a house and they each have joint ownership with the others.&nbsp; If any die, then the ownership of the deceased person goes to all the remaining owners in proportion to their ownership of the property.</p>\n\n<p>A Transfer on Death deed is a relatively new form of transfer in Ohio.&nbsp; It allows an owner to transfer property to another person (the beneficiary) directly, upon the death of the owner.&nbsp; The beneficiary has no rights to the property at all, until the death of the owner.&nbsp; This can be a very useful device for making efficient estate planning arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Executor or Trustee Deed is used by a person who is the executor of a person's estate, or the trustee of a trust (among other fiduciary actions).&nbsp; It is not so common in relative terms, but is necessary when dealing with an estate or with property held in trust.</p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend that people speak with their attorney to determine how to best recognize their ownership of real property.&nbsp; Our homes are typically one of our most valuable assets and represent a significant portion of our net worth.&nbsp; It is important to get good advice on how best to manage our property.&nbsp; Commonly, these issues are examined in a larger estate planning process.&nbsp; But you don't have to have millions of dollars to justify making an estate plan.&nbsp; It does require some thought about what you want to do, and who you want to benefit as time goes forward.&nbsp; Even for most middle class individuals, this requires some thought and preparation to be sure you benefit from the available tools, such as the proper deed on your property.</p></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://fredmischler.blogs.com/frederick_focke_mischler/atom.xml", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/188/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1221, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Neil Young concert", "text": "This past Sunday night I attended my first rock concert since Pavement last September: Neil Young in Avery Fisher Hall.

U.S.) holding that the so-called <em>Chevron</em> doctrine of very broad interpretive deference to the regulations issued by administrative agencies, does indeed apply to tax regulations (but not to less formal administrative statements, such as the issuance of IRS Revenue Rulings), and (b) the occasional IRS practice of issuing what are called \"fighting regulations\" or rulings, i.e., those issued during the course of a particular litigation and purporting to affect its outcome, not just future cases.<br /><br />Constitutional and administrative law, along with statutory interpretation, have the odd feature of lacking a determinate framework for decision.  By contrast, if one is assessing tax policy questions, say from a particular welfare economics framework, then in principle there is an agreed methodology for determining what the right answer is.  But that said, I personally find <em>Chevron</em> deference to Treasury regulations both interpretively plausible and likely to have predominantly good effects.  The latter impression, however, is based on a set of very general assumptions or beliefs about how the Treasury currently acts and about how courts or Congress (if not allowed to delegate as much) would do in its stead.<br /><br />The \"fighting regulations\" problem can be put in focus by imagining that the IRS, whenever facing litigation, could have the Treasury issue a regulation applying just to that case, and purporting to solve it in the government's favor.  If (a) the government had time to do \"notice and comment\" on the regulation, (b) the courts would stand for it, and (c) it was consistent with statutory restrictions on regulatory retroactivity, it would cause the IRS always to win all of its litigation so long as, under the <em>Chevron</em> standard, the regulation adopted a defensible interpretation of underlying statutes and was not \"arbitrary or capricious.\"<br /><br />But on the other hand, if litigation alerts the IRS to a problem it didn't previously know about (e.g., due to a particular taxpayer's clever and aggressive planning), and if it can address the problem prospectively through regulations that reasonably interpret the law to shut down the game, why should the first mover in effect be grandfathered, creating stronger incentives to look for these things.  (In a separate legal context, this is a big piece of the case for a broad economic substance standard in combatting tax shelters.)  While I as a judge would want to cast a very skeptical eye on this-case-only regulations (and I'm sure most actual judges would as well), the fact that the IRS or Treasury is willing to publish a broader and more authoritative statement than its attorneys' briefs to the court, having future applicability to other situations, is indeed meaningful, and should be taken as such.  So even mere revenue rulings, even when issued in the middle of litigation, while not determinative, are also not equivalent to mere assertions in the government brief.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-2229815294469604336?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/191/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1223, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "April 14 Tax Policy Colloquium (with Josh Blank)", "text": "Last Thursday at the colloquium, Josh Blank presented his paper, <a href=\"/posts/external/72/\">In Defense of Tax Privacy</a>.  The main argument the paper makes is that individuals' tax return data shouldn't be publicized (i.e., present law in this regard should continue), not because privacy is an important value but rather because compliance would be undermined if it were easier for people to figure out how feeble the IRS's auditing resources are, and how easy it in fact is to cheat and get away with it.<br /><br />As things stand, the IRS does the best it can to make a brave show of being on top of the game - e.g., celebrity prosecutions, triumphant enforcement announcements on the days leading to April 15, etcetera.  My own view is that this approach is more likely to work with the general public than with the more hardcore types who actually are inclined to play the audit lottery.  The sheep and the gamers, to borrow but revise Alex Raskolnikov's <a href=\"/posts/external/73/\">terminology</a>, are different groups calling for different strategies.<br /><br />Also, I'd say that the privacy issues actually matter with respect to individuals - but not public corporations, as to which there should definitely be MUCH more published tax return information.  Suppose, however, that one isn't worried about individual taxpayers' privacy for its own sake, but shares the paper's concern that permitting the press to find and publicize instances of notorious tax avoidance or evasion would end up undermining compliance, without aiding IRS enforcement given the agency's limited resources.  Then arguably the proper response is to give private parties strong financial incentives to find (and perhaps even participate in litigating) tax underpayments by others.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-4087183400288261686?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/192/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1225, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Income tax burdens on the average family of four", "text": "Yesterday being Tax Day (the due date for on-time calendar year income tax returns), there were naturally various stories in the media about people's tax burdens and such.  One that came up at least twice concerned that old chestnut of U.S. family structure, the good old \"family of four.\"<br /><br />As it happens, I was a member of such a family as a child, and I am again a member of such a family as a parent.  But meanwhile I suppose a lot of things have changed.<br /><br />In yesterday's NYT, Ross Douthat has an <a href=\"/posts/external/75/\">op-ed </a> mentioning \"families of four\" that I didn't get to read until today (I've been really busy lately).  I didn't have it in mind, therefore, when speaking yesterday to Natasha Lennart of Salon about the taxation of families of four, so it's lucky for me that her interest didn't lie in the Douthat column (although I suppose she would have told me if it did).<br /><br />As per Lennart's Salon <a href=\"/posts/external/76/\">column</a> that was posted yesterday evening, her interest lay in a report posted by the Tax Policy Center finding that, \"for the second year in a row, a family of four earning the median income is paying less in federal income taxes than at any time since at least 1955.\"<br /><br />I posited that this presumably reflected not only continuation of the Bush tax cuts, but more particularly the continuing economic slowdown.  For example, suppose a lot of two-earner families are down to one earner.  While obviously this is bad for them if they want or even need the two incomes, it would certainly tend to reduce their tax liability.  If this is a major factor in the data, then presumably family-of-four tax liabilities will start rising again if employment levels ever get back to where they ought to be.<br /><br />In fact, however, I gather that the Tax Policy Center data is based on a representative two-parents, two-kids, one-earner family of four.  So it's lucky for me that I was only quoted saying things that actually are true:<br /><br />\"In 1955 'family of four' described a single-earner nuclear unit: a married man and woman with two children.<br /><br />\"'We're certainly more heterogeneous these days,' New York University's Wayne [Perry] Professor of Taxation, Daniel Shaviro, told Salon.\"<br /><br />Lennart then notes that, while the Tax Policy Center data that she was citing assumes a traditional 1950s-style family, \"in 2005, according to census data, 42 percent of families had two income earners, and around 34 percent of children lived in single-parent families. Of course, this does not change the fact that taxes are historically low. But the 'four person family' statistic does not pay attention to the fact that a dual-earner family is dually burdened with Social Security taxes and cannot claim the same spousal benefits. As Shaviro noted, 'Secondary earners are taxed fairly highly.'<br /><br />\"There is nothing misleading about analyzing the income tax burden of a married couple with two children with just one earning spouse. It is mistaken, however, to assume that is what's understood by the term 'family of four' in 2011.\"<br /><br />Anyway, back to parts of the interview that luckily didn't appear in the column.  Not having yet read the Douthat column, I suggested that, while household heterogeneity is an important issue in certain contexts - e.g., distributional effects of the fiscal system as between one-earner couples, two-earner couples, and singles, as well as the system's excessive discouragement of work by \"secondary earners\" in a couple - it wasn't necessarily crucial (in the sense that ignoring it would be misleading) when one is talking about historically low (since the 1950s) U.S. income tax burdens today, which presumably are a function of the rates plus the down economy.<br /><br />Douthart raises the issue as follows:<br /><br />\"Today ... a family of four making the median income \u2014 $94,900 \u2014 pays 15 percent in federal taxes. By 2035, under the C.B.O. projection, payroll and income taxes would claim 25 percent of that family\u2019s paycheck. The marginal tax rate on labor income would rise from 29 percent to 38 percent. Federal tax revenue, which has averaged 18 percent of G.D.P. since World War II, would hit 23 percent by the 2030s and climb even higher after that. <br /><br />\"Such unprecedented levels of taxation would throw up hurdles to entrepreneurship, family formation and upward mobility. (Or as the C.B.O. puts it, in its understated way, they would 'tend to discourage some economic activity,' and 'harm the economy through the impact on people\u2019s decisions about how much to work and save.')\"<br /><br />He makes this point to challenge the Obama side of what many see as the \"Obama versus Ryan\" debate over our fiscal future, on the view that entitlement growth (in particular on healthcare) will definitely have to slow, whether not as much or in the same manner as the Ryan plan posits.<br /><br />Douthat then got criticized (such as <a href=\"/posts/external/77/\">here</a>) for using an overstated income number.  Apparently the number he should have used, for taxable income purposes, is $75,700.  He has <a href=\"/posts/external/78/\">acknowledged</a> that he misread a chart that includes employment-based health insurance and the employer\u2019s share of payroll taxes, neither of which is in taxable income.  So we have a rare happy ending, in terms of on-line snark exchanges, as the above-linked critic accepts in an addendum that it was an honest mistake.<br /><br />But Douthat's choice of a representative family could be questioned as potentially misleading (albeit still, I trust, honestly so) in a sense that I would have mentioned, in my Salon interview with Lennart, if only, ahem, I had gotten to read the Douthat column in the morning (re-queue whining about how busy I am lately).  All else equal, Douthat would have had to cite lower numbers had he chosen a one-earner family or a single individual, given how joint returns amalgamate spousal incomes.  The relative burden on two-earner families, from how we treat such households via joint returns with rate brackets being significantly less than double those on single returns, is important, but makes such a family not entirely representative.  (So re-queue here the heterogeneity point.)<br /><br />Another important aspect that Douthat may not have recognized was the following.  The tax rate increase for two-earner families that he shows presumably reflects a key fact about income tax brackets under present law.  They are indexed for inflation, but not for real GDP growth.  Accordingly, there is a tendency over time for movement towards having <em>everyone</em>, not just high-earners, end up in the top bracket.<br /><br />E.g., suppose that, with the gracious assistance of <a href=\"/posts/external/79/\">Wikipedia</a>, we compare median incomes, in constant (i.e., inflation-adjusted) dollars for past eras as compared to today.  Between 1950 and 2000, the U.S. median income for men grew 80 percent in real terms, while that for women almost tripled.  (The latter, of course, also reflects women's greater entry into the workforce.)<br /><br />For this reason, when economists try to project future tax revenues under a \"current policy\" approach rather than a \"current law\" approach, they will typically assume that, over time, tax rate brackets are roughly indexed for real GDP growth, as well as for inflation, thus causing the brackets to kick in at the same points in the contemporary income distribution in, say, the 2030s as today.  After all, permitting the U.S. income tax to evolve into a system in which more and more people hit the top rate bracket would be a genuine policy change, albeit the natural consequence of simple legal inertia.<br /><br />Obviously, a long-term U.S. fiscal gap and what I would call a reasonable (and indeed indispensable) willingness to address it on the tax side, as well as on the spending side, would naturally raise the question of whether we should continue current rate bracket policy by raising the tax rate brackets for real GDP growth as well as for inflation.  But my default would certainly be to assume current policy in this regard.<br /><br />While I'm sure it was not deliberate, I do think that Douthat's column ends up being potentially misleading in substance insofar as it treats real bracket creep as illuminating with regard to whether we should raise tax rates (at least for the top bracket) in keeping with Obama's but not Ryan's plan.  The question of how high tax rates should be is analytically distinct from where we should set the break points between brackets.  And the real bracket creep tendency of present law does not by itself carry any implication that the right solution is to lower the top rate a la the Ryan plan.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-5202444942441582558?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/194/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1226, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Above the fray", "text": "I like to be above the fray if possible.

For example, like many on the right, I'm skeptical about the political process, believe that markets can work well in a lot of areas (albeit less so for healthcare and the financial sector), and do not share the left's intense commitment to existing entitlement programs.<br /><br />The problem I have is that Republican devolution over the last 15 to 20 years leaves me all too often sounding more <a href=\"/posts/external/80/\">shrill</a> than I would like.<br /><br />For example, I've been forced to agree that the Ryan plan is neither serious, professional, credible, brave, nor responsible, even though (a) I would like to be able to reach a more positive conclusion, (b) someone with his general views could have met those criteria, (c) I appreciate that he's better on tax expenditures than the Norquist Republicans, and (d) I think it is within the realm of debates we should be having to argue for a more market-driven healthcare approach with vouchers (although in recent years I've moved away from agreeing with that view).<br /><br />I'm therefore happy to be able to link to an excellent <a href=\"/posts/external/81/\">post</a> in today's New York Times by Alan Viard of the American Enterprise Institute.<br /><br />In particular, I agree with Alan about the following:<br /><br />\"The Obama and Ryan plans have one striking similarity, as neither specifies which tax preferences will be curtailed or eliminated. Each plan will face hard choices when it comes time to spell out the details. Significant base broadening cannot be achieved by eliminating unpopular loopholes. <br /><br />\"Instead, it will be necessary to make major changes to at least some of the most widely used tax preferences, such as the exclusion of employer-provided health insurance and the deductions for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable giving. If the political will is found to make such changes, the income tax can be redesigned to facilitate a more efficient allocation of resources across economic sectors. For example, while such a tax system might still promote homeownership, it would no longer provide lavish subsidies for expensive houses.<br /><br />\"The economic gains from income tax base broadening are limited, though, because this approach does little or nothing to mitigate the saving and investment disincentives arising from the taxation of business profits, interest, dividends and capital gains. Long-run economic growth could be better advanced by replacing the entire income tax system with a progressive consumption tax, but neither President Obama nor Representative Ryan has embraced that far-reaching reform.\"<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-2527000813011697049?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/195/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1227, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Excerpt from the Obama Administration's budget plan", "text": "A White House <a href=\"/posts/external/82/\">fact sheet</a> says the following about tax issues:<br /><br />1) \"The President\u2019s framework would seek a balanced approach to bringing down our deficit, with three dollars of spending cuts and interest savings for every one dollar from tax reform that contributes to deficit reduction.

The President supports the Fiscal Commission\u2019s goal of reducing tax expenditures enough to both lower rates and lower the deficit.\"<br /><br />COMMENT: As per my forthcoming Tax Notes article (coming out on May 23) concerning 1986-style tax reform, I would consider it foolish to lower tax rates in the current budgetary and distributional environment.  And if tax expenditures are actually \"spending through the tax code,\" then why should repealing them be deemed a \"tax increase\"?  After all, cutting substantively identical direct spending programs would not be deemed a tax increase.<br /><br />4) \"If by 2014, budget projections do not show that the debt-to-GDP ratio has stabilized and is declining in the second half of the decade, the [debt] failsafe [that the plan proposes] will trigger an across the board spending reduction, including on spending through the tax code.\"<br /><br />COMMENT: Okay, here it's accepted that tax expenditures are \"really\" spending.  Why not elsewhere as well?  Check out the discussion in my May 23 article of what tax expenditure analysis (in the public mind) has in common with viruses and zombies.<br /><br />5) \"[T]he President is continuing his effort to reform our outdated corporate tax code to enhance our economic competitiveness and encourage investment in the United States. By eliminating loopholes, reducing distortions and leveling the playing field in our corporate tax code, we can use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to the deficit.\"<br /><br />COMMENT: Don't expect anything to happen on this any time soon.

They should be irrevocably triggered to explode unless he and Obama turn a key together at the same time.<br /><br />--Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee must have gotten some confidential information that would be of enormous interest to Al Qaeda.

Pretty important stuff for tax policy and other such subjects - although what we think may not matter, given the perverse \"reverse insurance\" element of rising high-end wealth concentration, in that it feeds on itself by concentrating political and economic power in support of creating still greater wealth inequality.<br /><br />Until fairly recently, I would have said (and probably did say) that distributional concerns should really focus on helping people at the bottom, who may be in dire need.  I saw much less reason to worry about the top versus the middle, despite the relative status concerns that can make this topic emotionally salient (relative to helping those in need) to people who are in the middle to somewhat upper ranges.<br /><br />I still view that as the right approach for a steady state distribution that is not as top-heavy as the U.S. has become.  But, as the Stiglitz analysis (if you agree with it) can be construed to suggest, at a certain point one has to think about extreme high-end wealth concentration through a pollution frame, rather than a standard optimal income tax frame.<br /><br />More on this in my forthcoming (May 23) Tax Notes piece concerning 1986-style tax reform.  And among the big takeaways for this week's politics, what with Obama's upcoming speech on addressing long-term deficit issues, is that high-end marginal income tax rates absolutely should not be cut as part of fiscal rebalancing, no matter how much base-broadening there is (and I expect next to none anyway).  <br /><br />The case for cutting the corporate tax rate is stronger, given the pressures of global tax competition, but if that's done it's vital to address the potential use by high-income owner-employees of lower corporate rates as a tax shelter.  I was speaking to a practitioner the other day about the fact that lots of business owners are electing subchapter S status these days (under which a closely held company is taxed as a flow-through a la partnerships, with the income being taxed directly to owners rather than at the entity level).  This practitioner expects subchapter S elections to wither away if the corporate rate becomes significantly lower than the top individual rate, since the opportunity to use C corporations as a low-rate tax shelter will then simply be too tempting despite the accompanying disadvantages (such as having to worry about shareholder-level taxes).<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-173562972479114402?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/198/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1230, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Blind idealogue Alan Greenspan", "text": "I've been reading Johnson & Kwak's <a href=\"/posts/external/84/\">Thirteen Bankers</a>, and just saw a quote from Alan Greenspan that epitomizes a lot.<br /><br />The Fed had been reviewing whether subprime mortgage lending should be more highly regulated.  A 2000 Treasury-HUD report had found evidence of abusive \"predatory lending\" practices.  A brief side-note here: the law and economics movement has at times debunked, or at least seriously questioned, theories that sound a bit like this.  Predatory pricing, for example, has been challenged as a realistic business strategy in most circumstances where it is alleged (e.g., by rivals who can't match someone's low price).  But \"predatory lending\" makes easy, obvious, and straightforward economic sense as a business strategy, so long as home values keep rising.  You lend to a sucker who can't keep paying once the cushy early period ends, then you kick him out and have a chance of getting the home for below-value in the foreclosure sale.  (Plausible even though the sale is public, since real estate markets can be thin, and sales can be under-publicized.  Plus, you still break even if someone else assumes the full mortgage liability.)<br /><br />Securitization presumably changes the story to one in which the original lender is merely indifferent to whether the borrower defaults, rather than welcoming it.  Once the loan economics have been transferred to a big collective pool, it's other people's problem.  Subprime lenders simply wanted to make as many loans as possible for the transaction fees.  And downstream players were notoriously assuming that real estate prices would keep on rising forever, thus keeping borrower default a non-problem. <br /><br />Then-Fed governor the late Ned Gramlich urged that the Fed step in to regulate subprime mortgages more.  The banks that were making millions from the scam screamed bloody murder.  And of course Greenspan backed them, barring any regulatory change.  But what I found especially notable was the following Greenspan statement:<br /><br />\"Where once more marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit, lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and price that risk appropriately.  These improvements have led to rapid growth in subprime mortgage lending,\" etc.  (from Johnson-Kwak, p. 143.)<br /><br />What's wonderful about this  statement is not just the fact that it was untrue (at least, if one interprets it as asserting that the lenders actually <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">were</span> risk-pricing appropriately, not just that they were \"able\" to do so if they wanted).  Nor is it just the fact that inside players at the time knew it was untrue.  (They were counting on real estate prices to keep rising, and at least implicitly on a bailout if things turned ugly, NOT on appropriate pricing of credit risks.)<br /><br />No, what's wonderful about it is that Greenspan asserted it in the complete absence of any supporting evidence.  He believed it because that is his theoretical view on how the economy operates.  He didn't need no stinkin' evidence, it just <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">had</span> to be true.<br /><br />And this notwithstanding the fact that one didn't need a theory of individual-level irrationality for it to be false - everyone could be acting rationally pursuant to their actual incentives and it could potentially be false.  To believe what he did, you need a crude and ignorant set of assumptions about how collective market institutions always get it right - no matter what incentives individuals actually have.  He truly was (and still is) our era's supreme Mister Magoo.<br /><br />When you combine Greenspan's anti-regulatory record with his serially bubble-priming monetary policy and the crucial political role he played in 2001 in helping President Bush to destroy U.S. budget surpluses and put us firmly on the road to long-term default, Greenspan is pretty clearly #1 in U.S. history in a singular sense.  He has done more lifetime harm to our economy than any other U.S. public official who has ever lived.  (Indeed, among all individuals who have ever lived, I would think that only those who waged war on the U.S. could otherwise compete with him in this regard.)<br /><br />To be fair, lots of other people share in the blame for recent economic and regulatory policy (and they come from both political parties).  Plus, one has to think about 1929.  But while there the overall harm may have been greater (at least, scaled to contemporary population and the size of the economy), no one individual from that era is entitled to claim nearly as high a share of the blame - e.g., certainly not the unlucky if inadequate Hoover.<br /><br />UPDATE: Re-reading this post a couple of hours later, while I'm still comfortable with what it says about Greenspan, the theory of history it evinces could be criticized as too much of a \"great man\" (or in this case \"bad man\") theory.  There were broader social and ideological forces behind what Greenspan did that made his policies, if not quite inevitable, at least (a) far more rewarding to him than any alternative set of policies he could have followed and (b) highly likely to be followed no matter who held his position.  But that doesn't make individual responsibility either wholly irrelevant or meaningless.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-835918443162371968?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/199/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1231, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "The budget deal", "text": "Way to go, Washington.

Where a company chooses the PRE designation, the accounting treatment jumps from (a) assuming full, immediate, and certain U.S. taxation, albeit subject to the ability to claim foreign tax credits, to (b) assuming zero residual U.S. tax.<br /><br />If reported earnings matter, this is obviously an appealing thing to be able to do.  But investors can learn, from looking elsewhere on the companies' financial statements, how much they have by way of unrepatriated foreign earnings.  Suppose the PRE designation is pure \"cheap talk\" that does not itself affect the subsequent likelihood of repatriation.  In principle, choosing it would bring no stock price advantage if, with or without it, investors could and did assess for themselves the likelihood of repatriation and the U.S. tax hit that this would entail.<br /><br />In the world we actually live in, however, where managers like high earnings and the numbers on earnings lines appear to matter more than they seemingly should, the PRE designation is obviously attractive to managers because it permits them to claim higher earnings, albeit at the price of having a negative adjustment later on if they end up bringing some of the money home.  (Whereas, if they don't claim PRE, I believe that paying the tax one already said was going to pay has no financial reporting downside, at least on the income line.)<br /><br />The paper finds that \"reporting incentives have a negative effect on the amount of foreign earnings repatriated by MNCs .... [F]inancial reporting is an important factor in the repatriation decision of U.S. MNCs.\"<br /><br />Every practicing tax lawyer I have ever spoken with about the role that accounting considerations plsy in companies' tax planning would say \"OF COURSE this is true.\"  They are quite aware of operating in a world where, as I once heard an investment banker say\" Saving taxes is all very nice, but earnings per share make the world go round.\"<br /><br />On the other hand, any economist with a strong University of Chicago-style orientation would likely be extremely reluctant to believe it could possibly be true.  \"That may work in practice, but it definitely doesn't work in theory\" is probably about the strongest concession one could ever hope to get from such an individual.<br /><br />Some takeaways from accepting the paper's finding (as I do) include the following:<br /><br />1) As proponents of both worldwide and territorial appraoches to U.S. taxation of resident MNCs can agree, the deferred tax on repatriation of foreign earnings has undesirable incentive effects, inducing companies to engage in costly maneuvers to arrange their global cash as they prefer in the most \"tax-efficient\" manner.  (There are theoretical conditions in which this actually might not be so - a point made by the so-called \"new view\" of cross-border dividend taxation, but the key precondition, a constant rate of repatriation tax that will at some point inevitably be paid, does not actually hold.)  It's ironic, if that's the word for it, that a mere accounting rule, as opposed to the actual substantive rules of taxation, should also create lock-in.<br /><br />2) There probably is no good accounting rationale for allowing the PRE designation, which is ridiculously discontinuous.  Repatriation is treated as a one-or-zero decision rather than a probabilistic continuum as it more likely would be in practice.  And managers get one more avenue for gameplaying.  Other accounting rules in the neighborhood are also bad, however, such as not present-value-discounting expected future taxes, and the degree of secrecy companies are permitted regarding their U.S. and foreign tax positions and current payments is probably indefensible.<br /><br />3) In principle, accounting design should take account of the real world consequences (outside accounting) that adopting a particular rule may have.  Accountants generally resist this, however, and for a good structural reason.  They are concerned that the long-run effects of opening the door to such arguments, which corporate insiders would then make to lobby for bad accounting rules that they hoped would reduce transparency, would be predominantly negative.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/9208928-996560283265680512?l=danshaviro.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/201/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1240, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Tax Evasion Arguments", "text": "<div><p>Here's a post from the National Association of Tax Professionals, that says it as well as I think I can.&nbsp; Most of these arguments are good for a chuckle or two.&nbsp; It continually amazes me how people can put forth these ideas and appear to sincerely believe them.&nbsp; But, I guess that is all a testament to human nature, greed, and that we tend to believe what we want to hear.&nbsp; &nbsp;-- FM</p>\n\n<h2 align=\"center\" style=\"line-height: normal; text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Lawsuit-Happy Tax Protesters Tax \nthe Legal System</span></span></strong></h2>\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;\">The \nVerdict \u2013 Pay What You Owe</span></span></strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: 150%;\"><span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial;\">National \nAssociation of Tax Professionals (NATP) Appleton, WI \u2013 Paying taxes violates the \nfirst amendment (or the fifth or thirteenth or fifteenth\u2026); I am a citizen of my \nstate, not of the United States; the war goes against my religious beliefs so my \ntaxes should not fund it; if I don\u2019t file a tax return, the government is \nresponsible for filing for me; because I am disabled or a minority, I am exempt \nfrom paying taxes; my assets are in a trust not subject to taxation.

Or, you can give $12,000 each to your 5 children and the transfer can be complete in 1 year.&nbsp; As long as no one receives more than $12,000 in one year, no gift tax will be owed when the gift is made and the gift will not be taxed at death as part of the estate tax.</p>\n\n<p>Note the connection to estate taxes.&nbsp; This was done so that whether your estate is taxed at your death, or when you give it away while still living, the IRS will get some portion of it at some time.&nbsp; But, as I noted, both these taxes are not likely to affect the majority of taxpayers.&nbsp; Right now, the gift tax exclusion over a lifetime is $1,000,000.&nbsp; So, you will have to give away that much before you pay any gift taxes.&nbsp; The estate tax exclusion is even higher.&nbsp; For 2006, it is $2,000,000.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, if you gave your $60,000 small business to your child all in one year, you would be required to report that gift on a gift tax return.&nbsp; You would be able to exclude $12,000 as a gift exclusion in that year to your child, and $48,000 would be subject to gift taxes.&nbsp; However, you have the $1,000,000 lifetime exclusion so the amount subject to tax would be subtracted from the exclusion and no tax would be due until you gave away more than $1,000,000 during your lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, if you believe you have some possible exposure to gift taxes or estate taxes, you should consult with an attorney to review your net worth and the strategies you can employ to minimize your tax exposure.</p></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://fredmischler.blogs.com/frederick_focke_mischler/atom.xml", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/206/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1247, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Identity Theft", "text": "<div><p>Identity theft is a topic that has gotten increasing amounts of attention in recent years due to the rise of new ways to perform transactions, especially on the internet.&nbsp; The damage caused has been increasing many fold as well.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, we were all told to protect our credit cards and checkbooks from thieves.&nbsp; It's not hard to figure out how they might be able to steal from you if they have your credit cards or checkbook.&nbsp; But now, with increasing use of Social Security numbers as identifiers, that too needs to be closely protected, as well as bank account numbers, and all manner of other personal information.&nbsp; There are 2 prime ways to be an identity theft victim: </p>\n\n<p>1) <em>account takeover</em><br />This refers to the theft of existing bank or credit account information and the use of that information to complete purchases or obtain cash.<br />2) <em>true identity theft</em><br />This involves the theft of a Social Security number or other identification which is then used to open other accounts to obtain financial gain.</p>\n\n<p>It has been shown to be very easy to get personal information about people.&nbsp; Some of the ways it is done include dumpster diving, that is digging through trash at the dump, or even outside your own home, stealing mail from your mail box, taking credit card copies left at a store or restaurant, and&nbsp; getting information from internet sites.</p>\n\n<p>There are ways to protect yourself that are very easy to do.&nbsp; The most important is to examine the bank and credit card statements for your accounts.&nbsp; They are not just garbage, they are your key to keeping track of your money.&nbsp; This leads to the second excellent way to protect yourself: rip up or shred <strong>ALL</strong> documents that contain private information.&nbsp; If you are going to throw away a bank statement, shred it first.&nbsp; Here's one that almost got me.&nbsp; Almost every credit card statement I receive includes a page of checks that I can use to pay bills to transfer the balance to my credit card.&nbsp; Well, if you just throw that away, someone can pick it up and write themselves a check (or pay one of their own bills) and it goes on your credit card.&nbsp; <strong>SHRED everything that has your personal information!</strong>&nbsp; This also includes credit card applications you get as junk mail.</p>\n\n<p>Anymore, every application I get is preprinted with my name, and almost certainly with some kind of code to attach that application to my credit report.&nbsp; Someone filling this out and signing my name with their address will get a card in my name, and I would never know it until the card company tracks me down to say I owe them thousands of dollars.&nbsp; Shred those applications when you throw them away.&nbsp; (As I strongly suggest you do!)</p>\n\n<p>Get your credit report from all three credit reporting agencies at least once each year.&nbsp; Check it for errors and follow up on all errors to be sure they get corrected.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to protect yourself is to be VERY careful who gets to see your private information.&nbsp; Take your SS# off your driver's license and checks; don't let identification, like driver's license, social security card sit around unattended or open to other's to see; be sure to keep all credit card reciepts and rip them up if you don't intend to keep them</p>\n\n<p>Now, to be sure, there have been some protections against identity theft written into law.&nbsp; But the first defense is your own wisdom in protecting yourself.&nbsp; Even if you can't be legally responsible for someone else's theft, you still have to deal with the creditors banging on your door, or calling you demanding money.&nbsp; You might even have to hire a lawyer to represent you, which can be very expensive.&nbsp; So, the cheapest and most effective way to protect yourself is to use your head and keep an eye on everything that might have your personal information on it.&nbsp; Rip it up if you don't need to keep it, and keep it in a safe place if you do need to keep it.</p><br /></div>", "image": "", "source": "http://fredmischler.blogs.com/frederick_focke_mischler/atom.xml", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/209/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1248, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Happy April 15th!", "text": "<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">For those of you who have finished your annual duty of filing your taxes I hope it was as painless as possible. &nbsp;I enjoyed a successful tax season and while the busiest time of the year for me is just about over, I would like to take a moment to remind you to drop me an email any time throughout the year with any tax concerns.</span><br />\n<div><br />\n</div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">Tax law can change daily, please talk to your tax adviser before making decisions that will affect your taxes.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/376360401563767996-120872925368575058?l=glgcpa.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/external/98/\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/UadF6_rBqpfpXwSILYOlmFgJJRg/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"/posts/external/99/\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/UadF6_rBqpfpXwSILYOlmFgJJRg/1/di\" /></a></p>", "image": "", "source": "http://glgcpa.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/210/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1250, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Form W-2 and Form 1099s", "text": "<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">This is a quick reminder that the IRS requires that you furnish your employees their W-2 and your contractors their Form 1099 by Monday January 31, 2011.</span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\"><br />\n</span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">If you need assistance in meeting this deadline please contact me and I'll see if I can help you.</span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\"><br />\n</span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">Best wishes,&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">Gina</span><br />\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">http://GLGcpa.com</span><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">Tax law can change daily, please talk to your tax adviser before making decisions that will affect your taxes.<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/376360401563767996-3689918430127761348?l=glgcpa.blogspot.com\" width=\"1\" /></div>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/external/102/\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/iFAgGYr7fp7pQl6wwMOBFEhL8xU/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"/posts/external/103/\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/iFAgGYr7fp7pQl6wwMOBFEhL8xU/1/di\" /></a></p>", "image": "", "source": "http://glgcpa.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "rate": 0, "reference_link": "/posts/external/212/", "publication_date": "2011-05-23 01:55:50", "post_type": 1}}, {"pk": 1251, "model": "posts.post", "fields": {"profile": 20, "title": "Use Tax in QuickBooks", "text": "<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\"></span><br />\n<div style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman';

Having a degree in marketing, finance, accounting, and economics will give an individual a great number of skills that will help an individual become a successful entrepreneur or small business owner. The following includes some basic information about how a new degree will develop a person\u2019s skills and make him or her a better entrepreneur.</span></span><span style=\"color: #333333; line-height: 115%;\"><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"apple-style-span\">Marketing is key to any business. After all, one has to sell an idea to people of all ages and backgrounds. Understanding how to create a marketing plan takes time. One has to understand the different&nbsp;</span><span class=\"apple-style-span\">marketing tools around \u2013 everything from advertising in local publications and holding promotional events to using social networking items \u2013 and understanding how to target specific groups of people. A&nbsp;</span><span class=\"apple-style-span\">degree in marketing will teach a person how to perfect the art of customer service, how to word advertisements, and how to really make items look attractive to specific types of people (businessmen, stay at home mothers, college students, etc.).</span><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"apple-style-span\">Economics is more than just counting money. Instead, it\u2019s about understanding supply and demand. You need to be able to judge the market both in one\u2019s community and around the world to understand how to lure people into a business or make an idea economically smart. After all, if there are tons of breakfast places in a community, one may want to rethink starting another one. Instead, a new idea should&nbsp;</span><span class=\"apple-style-span\">satisfy a need people have. This means understanding how to entice people into coming into your new business and investing in goods and services. An economics degree will help people read the news and read&nbsp;</span><span class=\"apple-style-span\">economic-focused statistics to understand how the market is changing and how changing interest rates and trends could affect the price of one\u2019s goods as well as any small business loans one may have.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"apple-style-span\">A business degree is another important investment. Such a degree will help a person manage the day to day operations of a group. Running a business is more than having a store and selling goods. Instead, it is&nbsp;</span><span class=\"apple-style-span\">also about understanding the basics of accounting \u2013 so that every expense is accounted for \u2013 as well as basic payroll information. Treating employees right means taking care of taxes, making sure checks are on time, and ensuring all laws are followed. Update one\u2019s administrative skills and learn how to organize a store or price goods and services so that this idea or business is successful.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"apple-style-span\">Starting a business means making a plan and understanding the ins and outs of how to make the most of an idea. Thus, one should know how to make a budget, develop a marketing plan, how to gauge the every-changing market, and how to keep track of how funds are spent or used. With enough planning, one can make the most of an idea. Entrepreneurs will arm themselves with important skills and information if they earn new <a href=\"/posts/external/107/\">degrees</a>.</span></span></span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: #333333; line-height: 115%;\"><span class=\"apple-style-span\"><br />\n</span></span></span></div><div class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">This is a guest post from C.

any other service to be performed in your home.&nbsp;</span><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br />\n</span></div><div><span

their employer make you solely responsible for remittance of the Social Security and Medicare taxes. &nbsp;This means that if you fail to collect this tax from the employee (usually done through payroll withholding) you just increased your taxes because now you have to pay their share of Social Security and Medicare taxes as well as your share. &nbsp;In addition to Social Security and Medicare taxes, depending on the state you live in, you may also be subject to State Unemployment and disability insurance taxes.</span></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family:

wage (Federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 - you are required to pay the higher of the Federal or your state's minimum wage). &nbsp;If your household employee does not live with you, you are required to pay them one and one-half times their normal rate when they work more than 40 hours per week per Federal law (again your state law may be different and if it requires you to pay more than Federal that's what you have to pay).</span></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><br />\n</span></div><div><b><i><span

class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Most state require that employers report their household employee wages and remit their taxes quarterly, some allow annual reporting. &nbsp;In addition to these reporting requirements you are also required to provide a W-2 to your employee and submit a copy of the W-2 to the Social Security Administration as well as preparing another schedule (Schedule H) on your individual tax return. &nbsp;Many employers are surprised by the size of their annual employment tax liability for their household employee. &nbsp;This usually seems to fall in the $5,000 - $8,000 range. &nbsp;Most employers include this amount in their quarterly estimated tax payments.</span></div><div><b><i><br />\n</i></b></div><div><br

This is perfectly fine as long as the wages paid are considered \"reasonable\". &nbsp;The IRS can challenge the wages if they believe they are in excess of a reasonable salary and reclassify them as dividends. &nbsp;Having said this, the IRS can also challenge a S-Corporation's officer's salary if they believe the wage was too low and then they will want to reclassify the distributions taken as salary.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">Many retirement plan maximum contributions are based upon your salary. &nbsp;This usually negates the negative of paying payroll taxes on more wages.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">If you plan to retain profits in the corporation remember that in an S-Corporation you still have to pay taxes on that money - some shareholders may need a distribution in order to pay these taxes.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"Apple-style-span\"
